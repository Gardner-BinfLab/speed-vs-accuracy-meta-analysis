203.9667	495.0723	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24526711	training	A benchmark for comparison of cell tracking algorithms.	Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is an important task in many biomedical applications. A novel framework for objective evaluation of cell tracking algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell Tracking Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark. The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately. The challenge Web site (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) provides access to the training and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of the training videos. It also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.

De novo genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genomic sequence from countless small sequencing reads. Due to the complexity of this task, numerous genome assemblers have been developed to cope with different requirements and the different kinds of data provided by sequencers within the fast evolving field of next-generation sequencing technologies. In particular, the recently introduced generation of benchtop sequencers, like Illumina's MiSeq and Ion Torrent's Personal Genome Machine (PGM), popularized the easy, fast, and cheap sequencing of bacterial organisms to a broad range of academic and clinical institutions. With a strong pragmatic focus, here, we give a novel insight into the line of assembly evaluation surveys as we benchmark popular de novo genome assemblers based on bacterial data generated by benchtop sequencers. Therefore, single-library assemblies were generated, assembled, and compared to each other by metrics describing assembly contiguity and accuracy, and also by practice-oriented criteria as for instance computing time. In addition, we extensively analyzed the effect of the depth of coverage on the genome assemblies within reasonable ranges and the k-mer optimization problem of de Bruijn Graph assemblers. Our results show that, although both MiSeq and PGM allow for good genome assemblies, they require different approaches. They not only pair with different assembler types, but also affect assemblies differently regarding the depth of coverage where oversampling can become problematic. Assemblies vary greatly with respect to contiguity and accuracy but also by the requirement on the computing power. Consequently, no assembler can be rated best for all preconditions. Instead, the given kind of data, the demands on assembly quality, and the available computing infrastructure determines which assembler suits best. The data sets, scripts and all additional information needed to replicate our results are freely available at ftp://ftp.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pub/GABenchToB.

Next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have advanced progressively in sequence-based genomic research and novel biological applications with the promise of sequencing DNA at unprecedented speed. These new non-Sanger-based technologies feature several advantages when compared with traditional sequencing methods in terms of higher sequencing speed, lower per run cost and higher accuracy. However, reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as 454/Roche, ABI/SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa, are usually short, thereby restricting the applications of NGS platforms in genome assembly and annotation. We presented an overview of the challenges that these novel technologies meet and particularly illustrated various bioinformatics attempts on mapping and assembly for problem solving. We then compared the performance of several programs in these two fields, and further provided advices on selecting suitable tools for specific biological applications. 
269.3810	724.6667	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758764	training	Benchmarking short sequence mapping tools.	The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison. We applied our benchmarking tests on 9 well known mapping tools, namely, Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, MAQ, RMAP, GSNAP, Novoalign, and mrsFAST (mrFAST) using synthetic data and real RNA-Seq data. MAQ and RMAP are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining tools are based on indexing the reference genome. The benchmarking tests reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. The results show that no single tool outperforms all others in all metrics. However, Bowtie maintained the best throughput for most of the tests while BWA performed better for longer read lengths. The benchmarking tests are not restricted to the mentioned tools and can be further applied to others. The mapping process is still a hard problem that is affected by many factors. In this work, we provided a benchmarking suite that reveals and evaluates the different factors affecting the mapping process. Still, there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in all the tests. Therefore, the end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides the best results. 
303.1893	649.8495	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521762	training	Assessment of de novo assemblers for draft genomes: a case study with fungal genomes.	Recently, large bio-projects dealing with the release of different genomes have transpired. Most of these projects use next-generation sequencing platforms. As a consequence, many de novo assembly tools have evolved to assemble the reads generated by these platforms. Each tool has its own inherent advantages and disadvantages, which make the selection of an appropriate tool a challenging task. We have evaluated the performance of frequently used de novo assemblers namely ABySS, IDBA-UD, Minia, SOAP, SPAdes, Sparse, and Velvet. These assemblers are assessed based on their output quality during the assembly process conducted over fungal data. We compared the performance of these assemblers by considering both computational as well as quality metrics. By analyzing these performance metrics, the assemblers are ranked and a procedure for choosing the candidate assembler is illustrated. In this study, we propose an assessment method for the selection of de novo assemblers by considering their computational as well as quality metrics at the draft genome level. We divide the quality metrics into three groups: g1 measures the goodness of the assemblies, g2 measures the problems of the assemblies, and g3 measures the conservation elements in the assemblies. Our results demonstrate that the assemblers ABySS and IDBA-UD exhibit a good performance for the studied data from fungal genomes in terms of running time, memory, and quality. The results suggest that whole genome shotgun sequencing projects should make use of different assemblers by considering their merits. 
166.9200	420.6063	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20375457	training	Comparison of different algorithms for simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters in kinetic metabolic models.	Computational models in systems biology are usually characterized by a lack of reliable parameter values. This is especially true for kinetic metabolic models. Experimental data can be used to estimate these missing parameters. Different optimization techniques have been explored to solve this challenging task but none has proved to be superior to the other. In this paper we review the problem of parameter estimation in kinetic models. We focus on the suitability of four commonly used optimization techniques of parameter estimation in biochemical pathways and make a comparison between those methods. The suitability of each technique is evaluated based on the ability of converging to a solution within a reasonable amount of time. As most local optimization methods fail to arrive at a satisfactory solution we only considered the global optimization techniques. A case study of the upper part of Glycolysis consisting 15 parameters is taken as the benchmark model for evaluating these methods. 
213.9276	582.3354	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393030	training	Comparative study of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly strategies for transcriptome reconstruction based on RNA-Seq.	Transcriptome reconstruction is an important application of RNA-Seq, providing critical information for further analysis of transcriptome. Although RNA-Seq offers the potential to identify the whole picture of transcriptome, it still presents special challenges. To handle these difficulties and reconstruct transcriptome as completely as possible, current computational approaches mainly employ two strategies: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. In order to find the similarities and differences between them, we firstly chose five representative assemblers belonging to the two classes respectively, and then investigated and compared their algorithm features in theory and real performances in practice. We found that all the methods can be reduced to graph reduction problems, yet they have different conceptual and practical implementations, thus each assembly method has its specific advantages and disadvantages, performing worse than others in certain aspects while outperforming others in anther aspects at the same time. Finally we merged assemblies of the five assemblers and obtained a much better assembly. Additionally we evaluated an assembler using genome-guided de novo assembly approach, and achieved good performance. Based on these results, we suggest that to obtain a comprehensive set of recovered transcripts, it is better to use a combination of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. 
211.1518	582.1228	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22132132	training	RAxML and FastTree: comparing two methods for large-scale maximum likelihood phylogeny estimation.	Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML. 
337.5870	723.1899	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602402	training	Assessing the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment programs.	Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution. Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program. Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly. 
239.2220	683.8066	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25511303	training	Comparisons of computational methods for differential alternative splicing detection using RNA-seq in plant systems.	Alternative Splicing (AS) as a post-transcription regulation mechanism is an important application of RNA-seq studies in eukaryotes. A number of software and computational methods have been developed for detecting AS. Most of the methods, however, are designed and tested on animal data, such as human and mouse. Plants genes differ from those of animals in many ways, e.g., the average intron size and preferred AS types. These differences may require different computational approaches and raise questions about their effectiveness on plant data. The goal of this paper is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing (or transcription) detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to accomplish their goals. This study compares the eight popular public available software packages for differential splicing analysis using both simulated and real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data. All software are freely available. The study examines the effect of varying AS ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, AS types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation. Using a real data, the study looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected AS events using PCR studies. No single method performs the best in all situations. The accuracy of annotation has a major impact on which method should be chosen for AS analysis. DEXSeq performs well in the simulated data when the AS signal is relative strong and annotation is accurate. Cufflinks achieve a better tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when incomplete annotation is provided. Some methods perform inconsistently for different AS types. Complex AS events that combine several simple AS events impose problems for most methods, especially for MATS. MATS stands out in the analysis of real RNA-seq data when all the AS events being evaluated are simple AS events. 
225.2890	582.6116	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19046431	training	Comparison of methods for estimating the nucleotide substitution matrix.	The nucleotide substitution rate matrix is a key parameter of molecular evolution. Several methods for inferring this parameter have been proposed, with different mathematical bases. These methods include counting sequence differences and taking the log of the resulting probability matrices, methods based on Markov triples, and maximum likelihood methods that infer the substitution probabilities that lead to the most likely model of evolution. However, the speed and accuracy of these methods has not been compared. Different methods differ in performance by orders of magnitude (ranging from 1 ms to 10 s per matrix), but differences in accuracy of rate matrix reconstruction appear to be relatively small. Encouragingly, relatively simple and fast methods can provide results at least as accurate as far more complex and computationally intensive methods, especially when the sequences to be compared are relatively short. Based on the conditions tested, we recommend the use of method of Gojobori et al. (1982) for long sequences (&gt; 600 nucleotides), and the method of Goldman et al. (1996) for shorter sequences (&lt; 600 nucleotides). The method of Barry and Hartigan (1987) can provide somewhat more accuracy, measured as the Euclidean distance between the true and inferred matrices, on long sequences (&gt; 2000 nucleotides) at the expense of substantially longer computation time. The availability of methods that are both fast and accurate will allow us to gain a global picture of change in the nucleotide substitution rate matrix on a genomewide scale across the tree of life. 
355.9963	826.5816	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20617200	training	A comprehensive benchmark of kernel methods to extract protein-protein interactions from literature.	The most important way of conveying new findings in biomedical research is scientific publication. Extraction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) reported in scientific publications is one of the core topics of text mining in the life sciences. Recently, a new class of such methods has been proposed - convolution kernels that identify PPIs using deep parses of sentences. However, comparing published results of different PPI extraction methods is impossible due to the use of different evaluation corpora, different evaluation metrics, different tuning procedures, etc. In this paper, we study whether the reported performance metrics are robust across different corpora and learning settings and whether the use of deep parsing actually leads to an increase in extraction quality. Our ultimate goal is to identify the one method that performs best in real-life scenarios, where information extraction is performed on unseen text and not on specifically prepared evaluation data. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of nine different methods for PPI extraction that use convolution kernels on rich linguistic information. Methods were evaluated on five different public corpora using cross-validation, cross-learning, and cross-corpus evaluation. Our study confirms that kernels using dependency trees generally outperform kernels based on syntax trees. However, our study also shows that only the best kernel methods can compete with a simple rule-based approach when the evaluation prevents information leakage between training and test corpora. Our results further reveal that the F-score of many approaches drops significantly if no corpus-specific parameter optimization is applied and that methods reaching a good AUC score often perform much worse in terms of F-score. We conclude that for most kernels no sensible estimation of PPI extraction performance on new text is possible, given the current heterogeneity in evaluation data. Nevertheless, our study shows that three kernels are clearly superior to the other methods. 
396.0301	1001.9357	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475308	training	Improving RNA-Seq expression estimation by modeling isoform- and exon-specific read sequencing rate.	The high-throughput sequencing technology, RNA-Seq, has been widely used to quantify gene and isoform expression in the study of transcriptome in recent years. Accurate expression measurement from the millions or billions of short generated reads is obstructed by difficulties. One is ambiguous mapping of reads to reference transcriptome caused by alternative splicing. This increases the uncertainty in estimating isoform expression. The other is non-uniformity of read distribution along the reference transcriptome due to positional, sequencing, mappability and other undiscovered sources of biases. This violates the uniform assumption of read distribution for many expression calculation approaches, such as the direct RPKM calculation and Poisson-based models. Many methods have been proposed to address these difficulties. Some approaches employ latent variable models to discover the underlying pattern of read sequencing. However, most of these methods make bias correction based on surrounding sequence contents and share the bias models by all genes. They therefore cannot estimate gene- and isoform-specific biases as revealed by recent studies. We propose a latent variable model, NLDMseq, to estimate gene and isoform expression. Our method adopts latent variables to model the unknown isoforms, from which reads originate, and the underlying percentage of multiple spliced variants. The isoform- and exon-specific read sequencing biases are modeled to account for the non-uniformity of read distribution, and are identified by utilizing the replicate information of multiple lanes of a single library run. We employ simulation and real data to verify the performance of our method in terms of accuracy in the calculation of gene and isoform expression. Results show that NLDMseq obtains competitive gene and isoform expression compared to popular alternatives. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the detection of differential expression (DE) to show its usefulness in the downstream analysis. The proposed NLDMseq method provides an approach to accurately estimate gene and isoform expression from RNA-Seq data by modeling the isoform- and exon-specific read sequencing biases. It makes use of a latent variable model to discover the hidden pattern of read sequencing. We have shown that it works well in both simulations and real datasets, and has competitive performance compared to popular methods. The method has been implemented as a freely available software which can be found at https://github.com/PUGEA/NLDMseq . 
375.1588	842.8429	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708189	training	Comparison of mapping algorithms used in high-throughput sequencing: application to Ion Torrent data.	The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in HTS data analysis is the mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of evaluating mapping algorithms. In this paper, we present a benchmark procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in HTS using both real and simulated datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed CuReSim, a new read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of HTS technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. CuReSim and CuReSimEval, a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the CuReSim simulated reads, are freely available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a comparison has not yet been established. A benchmark procedure to compare HTS data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing platform. 
297.0365	784.7794	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18793413	training	Critical assessment of alignment procedures for LC-MS proteomics and metabolomics measurements.	Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with commonly used quality criteria. We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general. The multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the &quot;correct&quot; parameter settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition. All data as well as our evaluation scripts are available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap. 
66.1919	233.4880	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17151342	training	Exploring genomic dark matter: a critical assessment of the performance of homology search methods on noncoding RNA.	Homology search is one of the most ubiquitous bioinformatic tasks, yet it is unknown how effective the currently available tools are for identifying noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). In this work, we use reliable ncRNA data sets to assess the effectiveness of methods such as BLAST, FASTA, HMMer, and Infernal. Surprisingly, the most popular homology search methods are often the least accurate. As a result, many studies have used inappropriate tools for their analyses. On the basis of our results, we suggest homology search strategies using the currently available tools and some directions for future development. 
248.4604	611.2100	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17062146	training	The accuracy of several multiple sequence alignment programs for proteins.	There have been many algorithms and software programs implemented for the inference of multiple sequence alignments of protein and DNA sequences. The &quot;true&quot; alignment is usually unknown due to the incomplete knowledge of the evolutionary history of the sequences, making it difficult to gauge the relative accuracy of the programs. We tested nine of the most often used protein alignment programs and compared their results using sequences generated with the simulation software Simprot which creates known alignments under realistic and controlled evolutionary scenarios. We have simulated more than 30,000 alignment sets using various evolutionary histories in order to define strengths and weaknesses of each program tested. We found that alignment accuracy is extremely dependent on the number of insertions and deletions in the sequences, and that indel size has a weaker effect. We also considered benchmark alignments from the latest version of BAliBASE and the results relative to BAliBASE- and Simprot-generated data sets were consistent in most cases. Our results indicate that employing Simprot's simulated sequences allows the creation of a more flexible and broader range of alignment classes than the usual methods for alignment accuracy assessment. Simprot also allows for a quick and efficient analysis of a wider range of possible evolutionary histories that might not be present in currently available alignment sets. Among the nine programs tested, the iterative approach available in Mafft (L-INS-i) and ProbCons were consistently the most accurate, with Mafft being the faster of the two. 
304.0929	721.8937	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23593445	training	An improved swarm optimization for parameter estimation and biological model selection.	One of the key aspects of computational systems biology is the investigation on the dynamic biological processes within cells. Computational models are often required to elucidate the mechanisms and principles driving the processes because of the nonlinearity and complexity. The models usually incorporate a set of parameters that signify the physical properties of the actual biological systems. In most cases, these parameters are estimated by fitting the model outputs with the corresponding experimental data. However, this is a challenging task because the available experimental data are frequently noisy and incomplete. In this paper, a new hybrid optimization method is proposed to estimate these parameters from the noisy and incomplete experimental data. The proposed method, called Swarm-based Chemical Reaction Optimization, integrates the evolutionary searching strategy employed by the Chemical Reaction Optimization, into the neighbouring searching strategy of the Firefly Algorithm method. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated using a simulated nonlinear model and two biological models: synthetic transcriptional oscillators, and extracellular protease production models. The results showed that the accuracy and computational speed of the proposed method were better than the existing Differential Evolution, Firefly Algorithm and Chemical Reaction Optimization methods. The reliability of the estimated parameters was statistically validated, which suggests that the model outputs produced by these parameters were valid even when noisy and incomplete experimental data were used. Additionally, Akaike Information Criterion was employed to evaluate the model selection, which highlighted the capability of the proposed method in choosing a plausible model based on the experimental data. In conclusion, this paper presents the effectiveness of the proposed method for parameter estimation and model selection problems using noisy and incomplete experimental data. This study is hoped to provide a new insight in developing more accurate and reliable biological models based on limited and low quality experimental data. 
257.5675	742.3975	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701525	training	Comprehensive evaluation of protein structure alignment methods: scoring by geometric measures.	We report the largest and most comprehensive comparison of protein structural alignment methods. Specifically, we evaluate six publicly available structure alignment programs: SSAP, STRUCTAL, DALI, LSQMAN, CE and SSM by aligning all 8,581,970 protein structure pairs in a test set of 2930 protein domains specially selected from CATH v.2.4 to ensure sequence diversity. We consider an alignment good if it matches many residues, and the two substructures are geometrically similar. Even with this definition, evaluating structural alignment methods is not straightforward. At first, we compared the rates of true and false positives using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the CATH classification taken as a gold standard. This proved unsatisfactory in that the quality of the alignments is not taken into account: sometimes a method that finds less good alignments scores better than a method that finds better alignments. We correct this intrinsic limitation by using four different geometric match measures (SI, MI, SAS, and GSAS) to evaluate the quality of each structural alignment. With this improved analysis we show that there is a wide variation in the performance of different methods; the main reason for this is that it can be difficult to find a good structural alignment between two proteins even when such an alignment exists. We find that STRUCTAL and SSM perform best, followed by LSQMAN and CE. Our focus on the intrinsic quality of each alignment allows us to propose a new method, called &quot;Best-of-All&quot; that combines the best results of all methods. Many commonly used methods miss 10-50% of the good Best-of-All alignments. By putting existing structural alignments into proper perspective, our study allows better comparison of protein structures. By highlighting limitations of existing methods, it will spur the further development of better structural alignment methods. This will have significant biological implications now that structural comparison has come to play a central role in the analysis of experimental work on protein structure, protein function and protein evolution. 
256.3204	669.3708	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20047664	training	A simulation study comparing supertree and combined analysis methods using SMIDGen.	Supertree methods comprise one approach to reconstructing large molecular phylogenies given multi-marker datasets: trees are estimated on each marker and then combined into a tree (the &quot;supertree&quot;) on the entire set of taxa. Supertrees can be constructed using various algorithmic techniques, with the most common being matrix representation with parsimony (MRP). When the data allow, the competing approach is a combined analysis (also known as a &quot;supermatrix&quot; or &quot;total evidence&quot; approach) whereby the different sequence data matrices for each of the different subsets of taxa are concatenated into a single supermatrix, and a tree is estimated on that supermatrix. In this paper, we describe an extensive simulation study we performed comparing two supertree methods, MRP and weighted MRP, to combined analysis methods on large model trees. A key contribution of this study is our novel simulation methodology (Super-Method Input Data Generator, or SMIDGen) that better reflects biological processes and the practices of systematists than earlier simulations. We show that combined analysis based upon maximum likelihood outperforms MRP and weighted MRP, giving especially big improvements when the largest subtree does not contain most of the taxa. This study demonstrates that MRP and weighted MRP produce distinctly less accurate trees than combined analyses for a given base method (maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood). Since there are situations in which combined analyses are not feasible, there is a clear need for better supertree methods. The source tree and combined datasets used in this study can be used to test other supertree and combined analysis methods. 
206.7507	656.9669	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21483869	training	A comprehensive benchmark study of multiple sequence alignment methods: current challenges and future perspectives.	Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), based on a new benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in combination to improve alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation in future evolutionary systems biology studies.

Identification of dispersed repetitive elements can be difficult, especially when elements share little or no homology with previously described repeats. Consequently, a growing number of computational tools have been designed to identify repetitive elements in an ab initio manner, i.e. without using prior sequence data. Here we present the results of side-by-side evaluations of six of the most widely used ab initio repeat finding programs. Using sequence from rice chromosome 12, tools were compared with regard to time requirements, ability to find known repeats, utility in identifying potential novel repeats, number and types of repeat elements recognized and compactness of family descriptions. The study reveals profound differences in the utility of the tools with some identifying virtually their entire substrate as repetitive, others making reasonable estimates of repetition, and some missing almost all repeats. Of note, even when tools recognized similar numbers of repeats they often showed marked differences in the nature and number of repeat families identified. Within the context of this comparative study, ReAS and RepeatScout showed the most promise in analysis of sequence reads and assembled genomic regions, respectively. Our results should help biologists identify the program(s), if any, that is best suited for their needs. 
251.0623	529.3037	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21423806	training	A practical comparison of de novo genome assembly software tools for next-generation sequencing technologies.	The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies is accompanied with the development of many whole-genome sequence assembly methods and software, especially for de novo fragment assembly. Due to the poor knowledge about the applicability and performance of these software tools, choosing a befitting assembler becomes a tough task. Here, we provide the information of adaptivity for each program, then above all, compare the performance of eight distinct tools against eight groups of simulated datasets from Solexa sequencing platform. Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory (RAM) occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which SOAPdenovo is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential information for the improvement of existing assemblers or the developing of novel assemblers. 
94.0489	345.1415	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25760244	training	An assessment of bacterial small RNA target prediction programs.	Most bacterial regulatory RNAs exert their function through base-pairing with target RNAs. Computational prediction of targets is a busy research field that offers biologists a variety of web sites and software. However, it is difficult for a non-expert to evaluate how reliable those programs are. Here, we provide a simple benchmark for bacterial sRNA target prediction based on trusted E. coli sRNA/target pairs. We use this benchmark to assess the most recent RNA target predictors as well as earlier programs for RNA-RNA hybrid prediction. Moreover, we consider how the definition of mRNA boundaries can impact overall predictions. Recent algorithms that exploit both conservation of targets and accessibility information offer improved accuracy over previous software. However, even with the best predictors, the number of true biological targets with low scores and non-targets with high scores remains puzzling. 
219.8226	675.3426	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152123	training	Fast and accurate methods for phylogenomic analyses.	Species phylogenies are not estimated directly, but rather through phylogenetic analyses of different gene datasets. However, true gene trees can differ from the true species tree (and hence from one another) due to biological processes such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and gene duplication and loss, so that no single gene tree is a reliable estimate of the species tree. Several methods have been developed to estimate species trees from estimated gene trees, differing according to the specific algorithmic technique used and the biological model used to explain differences between species and gene trees. Relatively little is known about the relative performance of these methods. We report on a study evaluating several different methods for estimating species trees from sequence datasets, simulating sequence evolution under a complex model including indels (insertions and deletions), substitutions, and incomplete lineage sorting. The most important finding of our study is that some fast and simple methods are nearly as accurate as the most accurate methods, which employ sophisticated statistical methods and are computationally quite intensive. We also observe that methods that explicitly consider errors in the estimated gene trees produce more accurate trees than methods that assume the estimated gene trees are correct. Our study shows that highly accurate estimations of species trees are achievable, even when gene trees differ from each other and from the species tree, and that these estimations can be obtained using fairly simple and computationally tractable methods. 
215.1039	576.8729	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839440	training	Objective and comprehensive evaluation of bisulfite short read mapping tools.	Background. Large-scale bisulfite treatment and short reads sequencing technology allow comprehensive estimation of methylation states of Cs in the genomes of different tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. Accurate characterization of DNA methylation is essential for understanding genotype phenotype association, gene and environment interaction, diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker, BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms (hash table and suffix/prefix tries). We examined their mapping efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads. We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, in terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and BS-Seeker with very similar performance. If CPU time is not a constraint, Bismark is a good choice of program for mapping bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of having increased false positives. Therefore, users should carefully set the related parameters depending on the quality of their sequencing data. 
266.6142	547.6411	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24086547	training	Comparing memory-efficient genome assemblers on stand-alone and cloud infrastructures.	A fundamental problem in bioinformatics is genome assembly. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads, which require large amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. With recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, it is expected that the memory footprint required for the assembly process will increase dramatically and will emerge as a limiting factor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. In this report, we compare current memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly with respect to quality, memory consumption and execution time. Our experiments prove that it is possible to generate draft assemblies of reasonable quality on conventional multi-purpose computers with very limited available memory by choosing suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the minimum memory requirements for different assembly programs even when data volume exceeds memory capacity by orders of magnitude. By combining existing methodologies, we propose two general assembly strategies that can improve short-read assembly approaches and result in reduction of the memory footprint. Finally, we discuss the possibility of utilizing cloud infrastructures for genome assembly and we comment on some findings regarding suitable computational resources for assembly.

46.6766	18.1344	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7922679	candidate	Exploratory analysis of multiple sequence alignments using phylogenies.	The significance of an alignment between two sequences can be determined using well-known techniques but cannot be easily evaluated with multiple alignments due to the computational complexity. Therefore multiple alignment algorithms may produce an alignment between sequences even when they have little homology with other sequences. A program is presented that makes use of a phylogeny to explore the implications of an alignment. Using the phylogeny, branch lengths are inferred and a search is conducted for regions of unusually rapid or slow rates of change given the observed rates in the rest of the sequence. A very rapid rate of change can be due to either poor homology or due to rapid divergence because of selection. Phylogenies are calculated using either the neighbor joining algorithm of Saitou and Nei (Mol. Biol. Evol., 4, 406-425, 1987) or a phylogeny supplied by the user. The program also permits randomization of subsections of the sequences to determine the significance of the multiple alignment for these individual regions. The combination of these two simple methods permits rapid and interactive exploration of multiple sequence alignments.

Retention time alignment is one of the most challenging steps in processing LC-MS datasets of complex proteomics samples acquired within a differential profiling study. A large number of time alignment methods have been developed for accurate pre-processing of such datasets. These methods generally assume that common compounds elute in the same order but they do not test whether this assumption holds. If this assumption is not valid, alignments based on a monotonic retention time function will lose accuracy for peaks that depart from the expected order of the retention time correspondence function. To address this issue, we propose a quality control method that assesses if a pair of complex LC-MS datasets can be aligned with the same alignment performance based on statistical tests before correcting retention time shifts. The algorithm first confirms the presence of an adequate number of common peaks (&gt;∼100 accurately matched peak pairs), then determines if the probability for a conserved elution order of those common peaks is sufficiently high (&gt;0.01) and finally performs retention time alignment of two LC-MS chromatograms. This procedure was applied to LC-MS and LC-MS/MS datasets from two different inter-laboratory proteomics studies showing that a large number of common peaks in chromatograms acquired by different laboratories change elution order with considerable retention time differences. 
337.5870	723.1899	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602402	training	Assessing the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment programs.	Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution. Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program. Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly.

A fundamental problem arising in the evolutionary molecular biology is to discover the locations of gene duplications and multiple gene duplication episodes based on the phylogenetic information. The solutions to the MULTIPLE GENE DUPLICATION problems can provide useful clues to place the gene duplication events onto the locations of a species tree and to expose the multiple gene duplication episodes. In this paper, we study two variations of the MULTIPLE GENE DUPLICATION problems: the EPISODE-CLUSTERING (EC) problem and the MINIMUM EPISODES (ME) problem. For the EC problem, we improve the results of Burleigh et al. with an optimal linear-time algorithm. For the ME problem, on the basis of the algorithm presented by Bansal and Eulenstein, we propose an optimal linear-time algorithm.

The probability model for periodic screening was extended to provide statistical inference for sensitivity depending on sojourn time, in which the sensitivity was modeled as a function of time spent in the preclinical state and the sojourn time. The likelihood function with the proposed sensitivity model was then evaluated with simulated data to check its reliability in terms of the mean estimation and the standard error. Simulation results showed that the maximum likelihood estimates of the proposed model have little bias and small standard errors. The extended probability model was further applied to the Johns Hopkins Lung Project data using both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Second-generation sequencing technologies produce a massive amount of short reads in a single experiment. However, sequencing errors can cause major problems when using this approach for de novo sequencing applications. Moreover, existing error correction methods have been designed and optimized for shotgun sequencing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the design of fast and accurate computational methods and tools for error correction of large amounts of short read data. We present SHREC, a new algorithm for correcting errors in short-read data that uses a generalized suffix trie on the read data as the underlying data structure. Our results show that the method can identify erroneous reads with sensitivity and specificity of over 99% and 96% for simulated data with error rates of up to 3% as well as for real data. Furthermore, it achieves an error correction accuracy of over 80% for simulated data and over 88% for real data. These results are clearly superior to previously published approaches. SHREC is available as an efficient open-source Java implementation that allows processing of 10 million of short reads on a standard workstation.

The explosive growth of next-generation sequencing datasets poses a challenge to the mapping of reads to reference genomes in terms of alignment quality and execution speed. With the continuing progress of high-throughput sequencing technologies, read length is constantly increasing and many existing aligners are becoming inefficient as generated reads grow larger. We present CUSHAW2, a parallelized, accurate, and memory-efficient long read aligner. Our aligner is based on the seed-and-extend approach and uses maximal exact matches as seeds to find gapped alignments. We have evaluated and compared CUSHAW2 to the three other long read aligners BWA-SW, Bowtie2 and GASSST, by aligning simulated and real datasets to the human genome. The performance evaluation shows that CUSHAW2 is consistently among the highest-ranked aligners in terms of alignment quality for both single-end and paired-end alignment, while demonstrating highly competitive speed. Furthermore, our aligner shows good parallel scalability with respect to the number of CPU threads. CUSHAW2, written in C++, and all simulated datasets are available at http://cushaw2.sourceforge.net liuy@uni-mainz.de; bertil.schmidt@uni-mainz.de Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

In 2001 and 2002, we published two papers (Bioinformatics, 17, 282-283, Bioinformatics, 18, 77-82) describing an ultrafast protein sequence clustering program called cd-hit. This program can efficiently cluster a huge protein database with millions of sequences. However, the applications of the underlying algorithm are not limited to only protein sequences clustering, here we present several new programs using the same algorithm including cd-hit-2d, cd-hit-est and cd-hit-est-2d. Cd-hit-2d compares two protein datasets and reports similar matches between them; cd-hit-est clusters a DNA/RNA sequence database and cd-hit-est-2d compares two nucleotide datasets. All these programs can handle huge datasets with millions of sequences and can be hundreds of times faster than methods based on the popular sequence comparison and database search tools, such as BLAST. 
34.0843	19.1486	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17408237	candidate	A survey of population analysis methods and software for complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models with examples.	An overview is provided of the present population analysis methods and an assessment of which software packages are most appropriate for various PK/PD modeling problems. Four PK/PD example problems were solved using the programs NONMEM VI beta version, PDx-MCPEM, S-ADAPT, MONOLIX, and WinBUGS, informally assessed for reasonable accuracy and stability in analyzing these problems. Also, for each program we describe their general interface, ease of use, and abilities. We conclude with discussing which algorithms and software are most suitable for which types of PK/PD problems. NONMEM FO method is accurate and fast with 2-compartment models, if intra-individual and interindividual variances are small. The NONMEM FOCE method is slower than FO, but gives accurate population values regardless of size of intra- and interindividual errors. However, if data are very sparse, the NONMEM FOCE method can lead to inaccurate values, while the Laplace method can provide more accurate results. The exact EM methods (performed using S-ADAPT, PDx-MCPEM, and MONOLIX) have greater stability in analyzing complex PK/PD models, and can provide accurate results with sparse or rich data. MCPEM methods perform more slowly than NONMEM FOCE for simple models, but perform more quickly and stably than NONMEM FOCE for complex models. WinBUGS provides accurate assessments of the population parameters, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals for all examples. Like the MCPEM methods, WinBUGS's efficiency increases relative to NONMEM when solving the complex PK/PD models. 
37.4835	21.5475	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252881	candidate	ARYANA: Aligning Reads by Yet Another Approach.	Although there are many different algorithms and software tools for aligning sequencing reads, fast gapped sequence search is far from solved. Strong interest in fast alignment is best reflected in the $10(6) prize for the Innocentive competition on aligning a collection of reads to a given database of reference genomes. In addition, de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing long reads requires fast overlap-layout-concensus algorithms which depend on fast and accurate alignment. We introduce ARYANA, a fast gapped read aligner, developed on the base of BWA indexing infrastructure with a completely new alignment engine that makes it significantly faster than three other aligners: Bowtie2, BWA and SeqAlto, with comparable generality and accuracy. Instead of the time-consuming backtracking procedures for handling mismatches, ARYANA comes with the seed-and-extend algorithmic framework and a significantly improved efficiency by integrating novel algorithmic techniques including dynamic seed selection, bidirectional seed extension, reset-free hash tables, and gap-filling dynamic programming. As the read length increases ARYANA's superiority in terms of speed and alignment rate becomes more evident. This is in perfect harmony with the read length trend as the sequencing technologies evolve. The algorithmic platform of ARYANA makes it easy to develop mission-specific aligners for other applications using ARYANA engine. ARYANA with complete source code can be obtained from http://github.com/aryana-aligner. 
60.0868	39.0936	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974170	checked	Slider--maximum use of probability information for alignment of short sequence reads and SNP detection.	A plethora of alignment tools have been created that are designed to best fit different types of alignment conditions. While some of these are made for aligning Illumina Sequence Analyzer reads, none of these are fully utilizing its probability (prb) output. In this article, we will introduce a new alignment approach (Slider) that reduces the alignment problem space by utilizing each read base's probabilities given in the prb files. Compared with other aligners, Slider has higher alignment accuracy and efficiency. In addition, given that Slider matches bases with probabilities other than the most probable, it significantly reduces the percentage of base mismatches. The result is that its SNP predictions are more accurate than other SNP prediction approaches used today that start from the most probable sequence, including those using base quality. 
19.0214	2.1658	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23358824	candidate	Fast and accurate read mapping with approximate seeds and multiple backtracking.	We present Masai, a read mapper representing the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy. Our tool is an order of magnitude faster than RazerS 3 and mrFAST, 2-4 times faster and more accurate than Bowtie 2 and BWA. The novelties of our read mapper are filtration with approximate seeds and a method for multiple backtracking. Approximate seeds, compared with exact seeds, increase filtration specificity while preserving sensitivity. Multiple backtracking amortizes the cost of searching a large set of seeds by taking advantage of the repetitiveness of next-generation sequencing data. Combined together, these two methods significantly speed up approximate search on genomic data sets. Masai is implemented in C++ using the SeqAn library. The source code is distributed under the BSD license and binaries for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows can be freely downloaded from http://www.seqan.de/projects/masai. 
52.4402	41.2407	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19750212	checked	Fast mapping of short sequences with mismatches, insertions and deletions using index structures.	With few exceptions, current methods for short read mapping make use of simple seed heuristics to speed up the search. Most of the underlying matching models neglect the necessity to allow not only mismatches, but also insertions and deletions. Current evaluations indicate, however, that very different error models apply to the novel high-throughput sequencing methods. While the most frequent error-type in Illumina reads are mismatches, reads produced by 454's GS FLX predominantly contain insertions and deletions (indels). Even though 454 sequencers are able to produce longer reads, the method is frequently applied to small RNA (miRNA and siRNA) sequencing. Fast and accurate matching in particular of short reads with diverse errors is therefore a pressing practical problem. We introduce a matching model for short reads that can, besides mismatches, also cope with indels. It addresses different error models. For example, it can handle the problem of leading and trailing contaminations caused by primers and poly-A tails in transcriptomics or the length-dependent increase of error rates. In these contexts, it thus simplifies the tedious and error-prone trimming step. For efficient searches, our method utilizes index structures in the form of enhanced suffix arrays. In a comparison with current methods for short read mapping, the presented approach shows significantly increased performance not only for 454 reads, but also for Illumina reads. Our approach is implemented in the software segemehl available at http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/.

Dynamic multimedia fate models (MFMs) have to deal with the temporal and spatial variation of physical-chemical properties, environmental scenarios, and chemical emissions. In such complex simulation tools, an analytical solution is not practically feasible, and even a numerical approach requires a suitable choice of the method in order to obtain satisfying speed and reliability, particularly when certain combinations of modeling scenarios and chemical properties occur. In this paper, considering some examples of a wide range of realistic chemical and scenario properties, some sources of stiffness in MFM equations are pinpointed. Next, a comparison of the performances of several numerical schemes (chosen as representatives of three wide classes) is performed. The accuracy and the computational effort required by each method is evaluated, illustrating the general effectiveness of automatically adapted timesteps in numerical algorithms and the pros and cons of implicit timestepping. The results show that automatic error control methods can significantly improve the quality of the computed solutions and most often lead to relevant savings in computing time. Additionally, explicit and implicit methods are compared, indicating that an implicit method of medium order (around 5) is the best choice as a general purpose MFM computing engine.

Demand for fast, inexpensive, and accurate DNA sequencing data has led to the birth and dominance of a new generation of sequencing technologies. So-called &quot;next-generation&quot; sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of data by sequencing massive amounts of DNA in parallel using diverse methodologies which overcome the limitations of Sanger sequencing methods used to sequence the first human genome. Despite opening new frontiers of genomics research, the fundamental shift away from the Sanger sequencing that next-generation technologies has created has also left many unaware of the capabilities and applications of these new technologies, especially those in the clinical realm. Moreover, the brisk evolution of sequencing technologies has flooded the market with commercially available sequencing platforms, whose unique chemistries and diverse applications stand as another obstacle restricting the potential of next-generation sequencing. This review serves to provide a primer on next-generation sequencing technologies for clinical researchers and physician scientists. We provide an overview of the capabilities and clinical applications of DNA sequencing technologies to raise awareness among researchers about the power of these novel genomic tools. In addition, we discuss that key sequencing principles provide a comparison between existing and near-term technologies and outline key advantages and disadvantages between different sequencing platforms to help researchers choose an appropriate platform for their research interests.

Accurate sequence alignment is required in many bioinformatics applications but, when sequence similarity is low, it is difficult to obtain accurate alignments based on sequence similarity alone. The accuracy improves when the structures are available, but current structure-based sequence alignment procedures still mis-align substantial numbers of residues. In order to correct such errors, we previously explored the possibility of replacing the residue-based dynamic programming algorithm in structure alignment procedures with the Seed Extension algorithm, which does not use a gap penalty. Here, we describe a new procedure called RSE (Refinement with Seed Extension) that iteratively refines a structure-based sequence alignment. RSE uses SE (Seed Extension) in its core, which is an algorithm that we reported recently for obtaining a sequence alignment from two superimposed structures. The RSE procedure was evaluated by comparing the correctly aligned fractions of residues before and after the refinement of the structure-based sequence alignments produced by popular programs. CE, DaliLite, FAST, LOCK2, MATRAS, MATT, TM-align, SHEBA and VAST were included in this analysis and the NCBI's CDD root node set was used as the reference alignments. RSE improved the average accuracy of sequence alignments for all programs tested when no shift error was allowed. The amount of improvement varied depending on the program. The average improvements were small for DaliLite and MATRAS but about 5% for CE and VAST. More substantial improvements have been seen in many individual cases. The additional computation times required for the refinements were negligible compared to the times taken by the structure alignment programs. RSE is a computationally inexpensive way of improving the accuracy of a structure-based sequence alignment. It can be used as a standalone procedure following a regular structure-based sequence alignment or to replace the traditional iterative refinement procedures based on residue-level dynamic programming algorithm in many structure alignment programs.

We present a new method for developing individualized biomathematical models that predict performance impairment for individuals restricted to total sleep loss. The underlying formulation is based on the two-process model of sleep regulation, which has been extensively used to develop group-average models. However, in the proposed method, the parameters of the two-process model are systematically adjusted to account for an individual's uncertain initial state and unknown trait characteristics, resulting in individual-specific performance prediction models. The method establishes the initial estimates of the model parameters using a set of past performance observations, after which the parameters are adjusted as each new observation becomes available. Moreover, by transforming the nonlinear optimization problem of finding the best estimates of the two-process model parameters into a set of linear optimization problems, the proposed method yields unique parameter estimates. Two distinct data sets are used to evaluate the proposed method. Results of simulated data (with superimposed noise) show that the model parameters asymptotically converge to their true values and the model prediction accuracy improves as the number of performance observations increases and the amount of noise in the data decreases. Results of a laboratory study (82 h of total sleep loss), for three sleep-loss phenotypes, suggest that individualized models are consistently more accurate than group-average models, yielding as much as a threefold reduction in prediction errors. In addition, we show that the two-process model of sleep regulation is capable of representing performance data only when the proposed individualized model is used.

The application of Needleman-Wunsch alignment techniques to biological sequences is complicated by two serious problems when the sequences are long: the running time, which scales as the product of the lengths of sequences, and the difficulty in obtaining suitable parameters that produce meaningful alignments. The running time problem is often corrected by reducing the search space, using techniques such as banding, or chaining of high-scoring pairs. The parameter problem is more difficult to fix, partly because the probabilistic model, which Needleman-Wunsch is equivalent to, does not capture a key feature of biological sequence alignments, namely the alternation of conserved blocks and seemingly unrelated nonconserved segments. We present a solution to the problem of designing efficient search spaces for pair hidden Markov models that align biological sequences by taking advantage of their associated features. Our approach leads to an optimization problem, for which we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm, and that is based on the construction of Manhattan networks, which are close relatives of Steiner trees. We describe the underlying theory and show how our methods can be applied to alignment of DNA sequences in practice, successfully reducing the Viterbi algorithm search space of alignment PHMMs by three orders of magnitude.

Exhaustive mapping of next-generation sequencing data to a set of relevant reference sequences becomes an important task in pathogen discovery and metagenomic classification. However, the runtime and memory usage increase as the number of reference sequences and the repeat content among these sequences increase. In many applications, read mapping time dominates the entire application. We developed CompMap, a reference-based compression program, to speed up this process. CompMap enables the generation of a non-redundant representative sequence for the input sequences. We have demonstrated that reads can be mapped to this representative sequence with a much reduced time and memory usage, and the mapping to the original reference sequences can be recovered with high accuracy. CompMap is implemented in C and freely available at http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/zhuzx/CompMap/. xiaoyang@broadinstitute.org Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

With the rapid growth rate of newly sequenced genomes, species tree inference from multiple genes has become a basic bioinformatics task in comparative and evolutionary biology. However, accurate species tree estimation is difficult in the presence of gene tree discordance, which is often due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modelled by the multi-species coalescent. Several highly accurate coalescent-based species tree estimation methods have been developed over the last decade, including MP-EST. However, the running time for MP-EST increases rapidly as the number of species grows. We present divide-and-conquer techniques that improve the scalability of MP-EST so that it can run efficiently on large datasets. Surprisingly, this technique also improves the accuracy of species trees estimated by MP-EST, as our study shows on a collection of simulated and biological datasets. 
0.9870	21.1603	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22286085	candidate	A hyper-heuristic for the Longest Common Subsequence problem.	The Longest Common Subsequence Problem is the problem of finding a longest string that is a subsequence of every member of a given set of strings. It has applications in FPGA circuit minimization, data compression, and bioinformatics, among others. The problem is NP-hard in its general form, which implies that no exact polynomial-time algorithm currently exists for the problem. Consequently, inexact algorithms have been proposed to obtain good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions in an affordable time. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic algorithm incorporated within a constructive beam search is proposed for the problem. The proposed hyper-heuristic is based on two basic heuristic functions, one of which is new in this paper, and determines dynamically which one to use for a given problem instance. The proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on simulated and real biological sequences. Extensive experimental reveals that the proposed hyper-heuristic is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with respect to the solution quality and the running-time.

The score statistics of a recently introduced 'hybrid alignment' algorithm is studied in detail numerically. An extensive survey across the 2216 models of protein domains contained in the Pfam v5.4 database (Bateman et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 263-266, 2000) verifies the theoretical predictions: For the position-specific scoring functions used in the Pfam models, the score statistics of hybrid alignment obey the Gumbel distribution, with the key Gumbel parameter lambda taking on the asymptotic value 1 universally for all models. Thus, the use of hybrid alignment eliminates the time-consuming computer simulations normally needed to assign p-values to alignment scores, freeing the users to experiment with different scoring parameters and functions. The performance of the hybrid algorithm in detecting sequence homology is also studied. For protein sequences from the SCOP database (Murzin et al., J. Mol. Biol., 247, 536-540, 1995) using uniform scoring functions, the performance is found to be comparable to the best of the existing methods. Preliminary results using the PfamA database suggest that the hybrid algorithm achieves similar performance as existing methods for position-specific scoring systems as well. Hybrid alignment is thereby established as a high performance alignment algorithm with well-characterized, universal statistics.

The imperfect sequence data produced by next-generation sequencing technologies have motivated the development of a number of short-read error correctors in recent years. The majority of methods focus on the correction of substitution errors, which are the dominant error source in data produced by Illumina sequencing technology. Existing tools either score high in terms of recall or precision but not consistently high in terms of both measures. In this article, we present Musket, an efficient multistage k-mer-based corrector for Illumina short-read data. We use the k-mer spectrum approach and introduce three correction techniques in a multistage workflow: two-sided conservative correction, one-sided aggressive correction and voting-based refinement. Our performance evaluation results, in terms of correction quality and de novo genome assembly measures, reveal that Musket is consistently one of the top performing correctors. In addition, Musket is multi-threaded using a master-slave model and demonstrates superior parallel scalability compared with all other evaluated correctors as well as a highly competitive overall execution time. Musket is available at http://musket.sourceforge.net. 
18.3344	31.6675	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17951828	candidate	MANGO: a new approach to multiple sequence alignment.	Multiple sequence alignment is a classical and challenging task for biological sequence analysis. The problem is NP-hard. The full dynamic programming takes too much time. The progressive alignment heuristics adopted by most state of the art multiple sequence alignment programs suffer from the 'once a gap, always a gap' phenomenon. Is there a radically new way to do multiple sequence alignment? This paper introduces a novel and orthogonal multiple sequence alignment method, using multiple optimized spaced seeds and new algorithms to handle these seeds efficiently. Our new algorithm processes information of all sequences as a whole, avoiding problems caused by the popular progressive approaches. Because the optimized spaced seeds are provably significantly more sensitive than the consecutive k-mers, the new approach promises to be more accurate and reliable. To validate our new approach, we have implemented MANGO: Multiple Alignment with N Gapped Oligos. Experiments were carried out on large 16S RNA benchmarks showing that MANGO compares favorably, in both accuracy and speed, against state-of-art multiple sequence alignment methods, including ClustalW 1.83, MUSCLE 3.6, MAFFT 5.861, Prob-ConsRNA 1.11, Dialign 2.2.1, DIALIGN-T 0.2.1, T-Coffee 4.85, POA 2.0 and Kalign 2.0. 
44.3266	49.4397	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21989196	checked	Parameter estimation with bio-inspired meta-heuristic optimization: modeling the dynamics of endocytosis.	We address the task of parameter estimation in models of the dynamics of biological systems based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from measured data, where the models are typically non-linear and have many parameters, the measurements are imperfect due to noise, and the studied system can often be only partially observed. A representative task is to estimate the parameters in a model of the dynamics of endocytosis, i.e., endosome maturation, reflected in a cut-out switch transition between the Rab5 and Rab7 domain protein concentrations, from experimental measurements of these concentrations. The general parameter estimation task and the specific instance considered here are challenging optimization problems, calling for the use of advanced meta-heuristic optimization methods, such as evolutionary or swarm-based methods. We apply three global-search meta-heuristic algorithms for numerical optimization, i.e., differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA), particle-swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE), as well as a local-search derivative-based algorithm 717 (A717) to the task of estimating parameters in ODEs. We evaluate their performance on the considered representative task along a number of metrics, including the quality of reconstructing the system output and the complete dynamics, as well as the speed of convergence, both on real-experimental data and on artificial pseudo-experimental data with varying amounts of noise. We compare the four optimization methods under a range of observation scenarios, where data of different completeness and accuracy of interpretation are given as input. Overall, the global meta-heuristic methods (DASA, PSO, and DE) clearly and significantly outperform the local derivative-based method (A717). Among the three meta-heuristics, differential evolution (DE) performs best in terms of the objective function, i.e., reconstructing the output, and in terms of convergence. These results hold for both real and artificial data, for all observability scenarios considered, and for all amounts of noise added to the artificial data. In sum, the meta-heuristic methods considered are suitable for estimating the parameters in the ODE model of the dynamics of endocytosis under a range of conditions: With the model and conditions being representative of parameter estimation tasks in ODE models of biochemical systems, our results clearly highlight the promise of bio-inspired meta-heuristic methods for parameter estimation in dynamic system models within system biology. 
11.4538	12.8168	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861618	candidate	RAMICS: trainable, high-speed and biologically relevant alignment of high-throughput sequencing reads to coding DNA.	The challenge presented by high-throughput sequencing necessitates the development of novel tools for accurate alignment of reads to reference sequences. Current approaches focus on using heuristics to map reads quickly to large genomes, rather than generating highly accurate alignments in coding regions. Such approaches are, thus, unsuited for applications such as amplicon-based analysis and the realignment phase of exome sequencing and RNA-seq, where accurate and biologically relevant alignment of coding regions is critical. To facilitate such analyses, we have developed a novel tool, RAMICS, that is tailored to mapping large numbers of sequence reads to short lengths (&lt;10 000 bp) of coding DNA. RAMICS utilizes profile hidden Markov models to discover the open reading frame of each sequence and aligns to the reference sequence in a biologically relevant manner, distinguishing between genuine codon-sized indels and frameshift mutations. This approach facilitates the generation of highly accurate alignments, accounting for the error biases of the sequencing machine used to generate reads, particularly at homopolymer regions. Performance improvements are gained through the use of graphics processing units, which increase the speed of mapping through parallelization. RAMICS substantially outperforms all other mapping approaches tested in terms of alignment quality while maintaining highly competitive speed performance. 
32.0871	20.6023	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14642655	candidate	Improved Hidden Markov Model training for multiple sequence alignment by a particle swarm optimization-evolutionary algorithm hybrid.	Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the basic problems in computational biology. Realistic problem instances of MSA are computationally intractable for exact algorithms. One way to tackle MSA is to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are known to be very powerful in the related problem domain of speech recognition. However, the training of HMMs is computationally hard and there is no known exact method that can guarantee optimal training within reasonable computing time. Perhaps the most powerful training method is the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is fast, but bears the problem of stagnation at local optima. In the study reported in this paper, we used a hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization with evolutionary algorithms to train HMMs for the alignment of protein sequences. Our experiments show that our approach yields better alignments for a set of benchmark protein sequences than the most commonly applied HMM training methods, such as Baum-Welch and Simulated Annealing.

De novo genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genomic sequence from countless small sequencing reads. Due to the complexity of this task, numerous genome assemblers have been developed to cope with different requirements and the different kinds of data provided by sequencers within the fast evolving field of next-generation sequencing technologies. In particular, the recently introduced generation of benchtop sequencers, like Illumina's MiSeq and Ion Torrent's Personal Genome Machine (PGM), popularized the easy, fast, and cheap sequencing of bacterial organisms to a broad range of academic and clinical institutions. With a strong pragmatic focus, here, we give a novel insight into the line of assembly evaluation surveys as we benchmark popular de novo genome assemblers based on bacterial data generated by benchtop sequencers. Therefore, single-library assemblies were generated, assembled, and compared to each other by metrics describing assembly contiguity and accuracy, and also by practice-oriented criteria as for instance computing time. In addition, we extensively analyzed the effect of the depth of coverage on the genome assemblies within reasonable ranges and the k-mer optimization problem of de Bruijn Graph assemblers. Our results show that, although both MiSeq and PGM allow for good genome assemblies, they require different approaches. They not only pair with different assembler types, but also affect assemblies differently regarding the depth of coverage where oversampling can become problematic. Assemblies vary greatly with respect to contiguity and accuracy but also by the requirement on the computing power. Consequently, no assembler can be rated best for all preconditions. Instead, the given kind of data, the demands on assembly quality, and the available computing infrastructure determines which assembler suits best.

27.7758	13.7513	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22727112	candidate	A cooperative strategy for parameter estimation in large scale systems biology models.	Mathematical models play a key role in systems biology: they summarize the currently available knowledge in a way that allows to make experimentally verifiable predictions. Model calibration consists of finding the parameters that give the best fit to a set of experimental data, which entails minimizing a cost function that measures the goodness of this fit. Most mathematical models in systems biology present three characteristics which make this problem very difficult to solve: they are highly non-linear, they have a large number of parameters to be estimated, and the information content of the available experimental data is frequently scarce. Hence, there is a need for global optimization methods capable of solving this problem efficiently. A new approach for parameter estimation of large scale models, called Cooperative Enhanced Scatter Search (CeSS), is presented. Its key feature is the cooperation between different programs (&quot;threads&quot;) that run in parallel in different processors. Each thread implements a state of the art metaheuristic, the enhanced Scatter Search algorithm (eSS). Cooperation, meaning information sharing between threads, modifies the systemic properties of the algorithm and allows to speed up performance. Two parameter estimation problems involving models related with the central carbon metabolism of E. coli which include different regulatory levels (metabolic and transcriptional) are used as case studies. The performance and capabilities of the method are also evaluated using benchmark problems of large-scale global optimization, with excellent results. The cooperative CeSS strategy is a general purpose technique that can be applied to any model calibration problem. Its capability has been demonstrated by calibrating two large-scale models of different characteristics, improving the performance of previously existing methods in both cases. The cooperative metaheuristic presented here can be easily extended to incorporate other global and local search solvers and specific structural information for particular classes of problems.

Error Correction is important for most next-generation sequencing applications because highly accurate sequenced reads will likely lead to higher quality results. Many techniques for error correction of sequencing data from next-gen platforms have been developed in the recent years. However, compared with the fast development of sequencing technologies, there is a lack of standardized evaluation procedure for different error-correction methods, making it difficult to assess their relative merits and demerits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of many error-correction methods, and establish a common set of benchmark data and evaluation criteria to provide a comparative assessment. We present experimental results on quality, run-time, memory usage and scalability of several error-correction methods. Apart from providing explicit recommendations useful to practitioners, the review serves to identify the current state of the art and promising directions for future research.

New rapid high-throughput sequencing technologies have sparked the creation of a new class of assembler. Since all high-throughput sequencing platforms incorporate errors in their output, short-read assemblers must be designed to account for this error while utilizing all available data. We have designed and implemented an assembler, Quality-value guided Short Read Assembler, created to take advantage of quality-value scores as a further method of dealing with error. Compared to previous published algorithms, our assembler shows significant improvements not only in speed but also in output quality. QSRA generally produced the highest genomic coverage, while being faster than VCAKE. QSRA is extremely competitive in its longest contig and N50/N80 contig lengths, producing results of similar quality to those of EDENA and VELVET. QSRA provides a step closer to the goal of de novo assembly of complex genomes, improving upon the original VCAKE algorithm by not only drastically reducing runtimes but also increasing the viability of the assembly algorithm through further error handling capabilities.

We propose a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm and compare the alignment-quality and execution-time of the proposed algorithm with that of existing algorithms. The proposed progressive alignment algorithm uses a grammar-based distance metric to determine the order in which biological sequences are to be pairwise aligned. The progressive alignment occurs via pairwise aligning new sequences with an ensemble of the sequences previously aligned. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated via comparison to popular progressive multiple alignment approaches, ClustalW and T-Coffee, and to the more recently developed algorithms MAFFT, MUSCLE, Kalign, and PSAlign using the BAliBASE 3.0 database of amino acid alignment files and a set of longer sequences generated by Rose software. The proposed algorithm has successfully built multiple alignments comparable to other programs with significant improvements in running time. The results are especially striking for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient progressive alignment algorithm using a grammar based sequence distance particularly useful in aligning large datasets.

The database of known protein structures (PDB) is increasing rapidly. This results in a growing need for methods that can cope with the vast amount of structural data. To analyze the accumulating data, it is important to have a fast tool for identifying similar structures and clustering them by structural resemblance. Several excellent tools have been developed for the comparison of protein structures. These usually address the task of local structure alignment, an important yet computationally intensive problem due to its complexity. It is difficult to use such tools for comparing a large number of structures to each other at a reasonable time. Here we present GOSSIP, a novel method for a global all-against-all alignment of any set of protein structures. The method detects similarities between structures down to a certain cutoff (a parameter of the program), hence allowing it to detect similar structures at a much higher speed than local structure alignment methods. GOSSIP compares many structures in times which are several orders of magnitude faster than well-known available structure alignment servers, and it is also faster than a database scanning method. We evaluate GOSSIP both on a dataset of short structural fragments and on two large sequence-diverse structural benchmarks. Our conclusions are that for a threshold of 0.6 and above, the speed of GOSSIP is obtained with no compromise of the accuracy of the alignments or of the number of detected global similarities.

Mapping of short sequencing reads is a crucial step in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. ContextMap is an RNA-seq mapping algorithm that uses a context-based approach to identify the best alignment for each read and allows parallel mapping against several reference genomes. In this article, we present ContextMap 2, a new and improved version of ContextMap. Its key novel features are: (i) a plug-in structure that allows easily integrating novel short read alignment programs with improved accuracy and runtime; (ii) context-based identification of insertions and deletions (indels); (iii) mapping of reads spanning an arbitrary number of exons and indels. ContextMap 2 using Bowtie, Bowtie 2 or BWA was evaluated on both simulated and real-life data from the recently published RGASP study. We show that ContextMap 2 generally combines similar or higher recall compared to other state-of-the-art approaches with significantly higher precision in read placement and junction and indel prediction. Furthermore, runtime was significantly lower than for the best competing approaches. ContextMap 2 is freely available at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/ContextMap .

With the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms, there has been a reduction in the cost and time of sequencing. With these advantages, new challenges have emerged, such as the handling of large amounts of data, quality assessment, and the assembly of short reads. Currently, benchtop high-throughput sequencers enable the genomes of prokaryotic organisms to be sequenced within two hours with a reduction in coverage compared with the SOLiD, Illumina and 454 FLX Titanium platforms, making it necessary to evaluate the efficiency of less expensive benchtop instruments for prokaryotic genomics. In the present work, we evaluate and propose a methodology for the use of the Ion Torrent PGM platform for decoding the gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, for which 15 complete genome sequences have already been deposited based on fragment and mate-paired libraries with a 3-kb insert size. Despite the low coverage, a single sequencing run using a mate-paired library generated 39 scaffolds after de novo assembly without data curation. This result is superior to that obtained by sequencing using libraries generated from fragments marketed by the equipment's manufacturer, as well as that observed for mate-pairs sequenced by SOLiD. The generated sequence added an extra 91kb to the genome available at NCBI.

The nucleotide substitution rate matrix is a key parameter of molecular evolution. Several methods for inferring this parameter have been proposed, with different mathematical bases. These methods include counting sequence differences and taking the log of the resulting probability matrices, methods based on Markov triples, and maximum likelihood methods that infer the substitution probabilities that lead to the most likely model of evolution. However, the speed and accuracy of these methods has not been compared. Different methods differ in performance by orders of magnitude (ranging from 1 ms to 10 s per matrix), but differences in accuracy of rate matrix reconstruction appear to be relatively small. Encouragingly, relatively simple and fast methods can provide results at least as accurate as far more complex and computationally intensive methods, especially when the sequences to be compared are relatively short. Based on the conditions tested, we recommend the use of method of Gojobori et al. (1982) for long sequences (&gt; 600 nucleotides), and the method of Goldman et al. (1996) for shorter sequences (&lt; 600 nucleotides). The method of Barry and Hartigan (1987) can provide somewhat more accuracy, measured as the Euclidean distance between the true and inferred matrices, on long sequences (&gt; 2000 nucleotides) at the expense of substantially longer computation time. The availability of methods that are both fast and accurate will allow us to gain a global picture of change in the nucleotide substitution rate matrix on a genomewide scale across the tree of life.

Two natural parallelization strategies (best-first and simple hill-climbing) were implemented for the iterative refinement stage.

With improved short-read assembly algorithms and the recent development of long-read sequencers, split mapping will soon be the preferred method for structural variant (SV) detection. Yet, current alignment tools are not well suited for this. We present YAHA, a fast and flexible hash-based aligner. YAHA is as fast and accurate as BWA-SW at finding the single best alignment per query and is dramatically faster and more sensitive than both SSAHA2 and MegaBLAST at finding all possible alignments. Unlike other aligners that report all, or one, alignment per query, or that use simple heuristics to select alignments, YAHA uses a directed acyclic graph to find the optimal set of alignments that cover a query using a biologically relevant breakpoint penalty. YAHA can also report multiple mappings per defined segment of the query. We show that YAHA detects more breakpoints in less time than BWA-SW across all SV classes, and especially excels at complex SVs comprising multiple breakpoints. YAHA is currently supported on 64-bit Linux systems. Binaries and sample data are freely available for download from http://faculty.virginia.edu/irahall/YAHA. imh4y@virginia.edu.

Mathematical modeling is an important tool in systems biology to study the dynamic property of complex biological systems. However, one of the major challenges in systems biology is how to infer unknown parameters in mathematical models based on the experimental data sets, in particular, when the data are sparse and the regulatory network is stochastic. To address this issue, this work proposed a new algorithm to estimate parameters in stochastic models using simulated likelihood density in the framework of approximate Bayesian computation. Two stochastic models were used to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we designed another algorithm based on a novel objective function to measure the accuracy of stochastic simulations. Simulation results suggest that the usage of simulated likelihood density improves the accuracy of estimates substantially. When the error is measured at each observation time point individually, the estimated parameters have better accuracy than those obtained by a published method in which the error is measured using simulations over the entire observation time period.

In many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with commonly used quality criteria. We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, running time, and usability in general. The multitude of available alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the &quot;correct&quot; parameter settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition. All data as well as our evaluation scripts are available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap. 
266.6142	547.6411	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24086547	training	Comparing memory-efficient genome assemblers on stand-alone and cloud infrastructures.	A fundamental problem in bioinformatics is genome assembly. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads, which require large amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. With recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, it is expected that the memory footprint required for the assembly process will increase dramatically and will emerge as a limiting factor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. In this report, we compare current memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly with respect to quality, memory consumption and execution time. Our experiments prove that it is possible to generate draft assemblies of reasonable quality on conventional multi-purpose computers with very limited available memory by choosing suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the minimum memory requirements for different assembly programs even when data volume exceeds memory capacity by orders of magnitude. By combining existing methodologies, we propose two general assembly strategies that can improve short-read assembly approaches and result in reduction of the memory footprint. Finally, we discuss the possibility of utilizing cloud infrastructures for genome assembly and we comment on some findings regarding suitable computational resources for assembly.

Dynamic models of biochemical networks usually are described as a system of nonlinear differential equations. In case of optimization of models for purpose of parameter estimation or design of new properties mainly numerical methods are used. That causes problems of optimization predictability as most of numerical optimization methods have stochastic properties and the convergence of the objective function to the global optimum is hardly predictable. Determination of suitable optimization method and necessary duration of optimization becomes critical in case of evaluation of high number of combinations of adjustable parameters or in case of large dynamic models. This task is complex due to variety of optimization methods, software tools and nonlinearity features of models in different parameter spaces. A software tool ConvAn is developed to analyze statistical properties of convergence dynamics for optimization runs with particular optimization method, model, software tool, set of optimization method parameters and number of adjustable parameters of the model. The convergence curves can be normalized automatically to enable comparison of different methods and models in the same scale. By the help of the biochemistry adapted graphical user interface of ConvAn it is possible to compare different optimization methods in terms of ability to find the global optima or values close to that as well as the necessary computational time to reach them. It is possible to estimate the optimization performance for different number of adjustable parameters. The functionality of ConvAn enables statistical assessment of necessary optimization time depending on the necessary optimization accuracy. Optimization methods, which are not suitable for a particular optimization task, can be rejected if they have poor repeatability or convergence properties. The software ConvAn is freely available on www.biosystems.lv/convan.

Fast and exact comparison of large genomic sequences remains a challenging task in biosequence analysis. We consider the problem of finding all epsilon-matches between two sequences, i.e., all local alignments over a given length with an error rate of at most epsilon. We study this problem theoretically, giving an efficient q-gram filter for solving it. Two applications of the filter are also discussed, in particular genomic sequence assembly and BLAST-like sequence comparison. Our results show that the method is 25 times faster than BLAST, while not being heuristic.

Estimation of genomic breeding values is the key step in genomic selection. The successful application of genomic selection depends on the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values, which is mostly determined by the estimation method. Bayes-type and BLUP-type methods are the two main methods which have been widely studied and used. Here, we systematically introduce the currently proposed Bayesian methods, and summarize their effectiveness and improvements. Results from both simulated and real data showed that the accuracies of Bayesian methods are higher than those of BLUP methods, especially for the traits which are influenced by QTL with large effect. Because the theories and computation of Bayesian methods are relatively complicated, their use in practical breeding is less common than BLUP methods. However, with the development of fast algorithms and the improvement of computer hardware, the computational problem of Bayesian methods is expected to be solved. In addition, further studies on the genetic architecture of traits will provide Bayesian methods more accurate prior information, which will make their advantage in accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values more prominent. Therefore, the application of Bayesian methods will be more extensive.

A renewed interest in the multiple sequence alignment problem has given rise to several new algorithms. In contrast to traditional progressive methods, computationally expensive score optimization strategies are now predominantly employed. We systematically tested four methods (Poa, Dialign, T-Coffee and ClustalW) for the speed and quality of their alignments. As test sequences we used structurally derived alignments from BAliBASE and synthetic alignments generated by Rose. The tests included alignments of variable numbers of domains embedded in random spacer sequences. Overall, Dialign was the most accurate in cases with low sequence identity, while T-Coffee won in cases with high sequence identity. The fast Poa algorithm was almost as accurate, while ClustalW could compete only in strictly global cases with high sequence similarity. 
33.2676	3.1736	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12385990	candidate	An efficient and accurate distance based algorithm to reconstruct tandem duplication trees.	The problem of reconstructing the duplication tree of a set of tandemly repeated sequences which are supposed to have arisen through unequal recombination, was first introduced by Fitch (1977, Genetics, 86, 93-104), and has recently received a lot of attention. In this paper, we describe DTSCORE, a fast distance based algorithm to reconstruct tandem duplication trees, which is statistically consistent. As a cousin of the ADDTREE algorithm (Sattath and Tversky, 1977, Psychometrika, 42, 319-345), the raw DTSCORE has a time complexity in O(n(5)), where n is the number of observed repeated sequences. Through a series of algorithmic refinements, we improve its complexity to O(n(4)) in the worst case, but stress that the refined DTSCORE algorithm should perform faster with real data. We assess the topological accuracy of DTSCORE using simulated data sets, and compare it to existing reconstruction methods. The results clearly show that DTSCORE is more accurate than all the other methods we studied. Finally, we report the results of DTSCORE on a real dataset. http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/ 
43.4083	32.2349	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23413433	candidate	An approximate Bayesian approach for mapping paired-end DNA reads to a reference genome.	Many high-throughput sequencing experiments produce paired DNA reads. Paired-end DNA reads provide extra positional information that is useful in reliable mapping of short reads to a reference genome, as well as in downstream analyses of structural variations. Given the importance of paired-end alignments, it is surprising that there have been no previous publications focusing on this topic. In this article, we present a new probabilistic framework to predict the alignment of paired-end reads to a reference genome. Using both simulated and real data, we compare the performance of our method with six other read-mapping tools that provide a paired-end option. We show that our method provides a good combination of accuracy, error rate and computation time, especially in more challenging and practical cases, such as when the reference genome is incomplete or unavailable for the sample, or when there are large variations between the reference genome and the source of the reads. An open-source implementation of our method is available as part of Last, a multi-purpose alignment program freely available at http://last.cbrc.jp. martin@cbrc.jp Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

215.1039	576.8729	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24839440	training	Objective and comprehensive evaluation of bisulfite short read mapping tools.	Background. Large-scale bisulfite treatment and short reads sequencing technology allow comprehensive estimation of methylation states of Cs in the genomes of different tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. Accurate characterization of DNA methylation is essential for understanding genotype phenotype association, gene and environment interaction, diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker, BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms (hash table and suffix/prefix tries). We examined their mapping efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads. We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, in terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and BS-Seeker with very similar performance. If CPU time is not a constraint, Bismark is a good choice of program for mapping bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of having increased false positives. Therefore, users should carefully set the related parameters depending on the quality of their sequencing data. 
112.8491	10.7537	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25398475	candidate	MaxSSmap: a GPU program for mapping divergent short reads to genomes with the maximum scoring subsequence.	Programs based on hash tables and Burrows-Wheeler are very fast for mapping short reads to genomes but have low accuracy in the presence of mismatches and gaps. Such reads can be aligned accurately with the Smith-Waterman algorithm but it can take hours and days to map millions of reads even for bacteria genomes. We introduce a GPU program called MaxSSmap with the aim of achieving comparable accuracy to Smith-Waterman but with faster runtimes. Similar to most programs MaxSSmap identifies a local region of the genome followed by exact alignment. Instead of using hash tables or Burrows-Wheeler in the first part, MaxSSmap calculates maximum scoring subsequence score between the read and disjoint fragments of the genome in parallel on a GPU and selects the highest scoring fragment for exact alignment. We evaluate MaxSSmap's accuracy and runtime when mapping simulated Illumina E.coli and human chromosome one reads of different lengths and 10% to 30% mismatches with gaps to the E.coli genome and human chromosome one. We also demonstrate applications on real data by mapping ancient horse DNA reads to modern genomes and unmapped paired reads from NA12878 in 1000 genomes. We show that MaxSSmap attains comparable high accuracy and low error to fast Smith-Waterman programs yet has much lower runtimes. We show that MaxSSmap can map reads rejected by BWA and NextGenMap with high accuracy and low error much faster than if Smith-Waterman were used. On short read lengths of 36 and 51 both MaxSSmap and Smith-Waterman have lower accuracy compared to at higher lengths. On real data MaxSSmap produces many alignments with high score and mapping quality that are not given by NextGenMap and BWA.

79.0198	32.6891	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15374876	candidate	A memory-efficient algorithm for multiple sequence alignment with constraints.	Recently, the concept of the constrained sequence alignment was proposed to incorporate the knowledge of biologists about structures/functionalities/consensuses of their datasets into sequence alignment such that the user-specified residues/nucleotides are aligned together in the computed alignment. The currently developed programs use the so-called progressive approach to efficiently obtain a constrained alignment of several sequences. However, the kernels of these programs, the dynamic programming algorithms for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, run in (gamman2) memory, where gamma is the number of the constraints and n is the maximum of the lengths of sequences. As a result, such a high memory requirement limits the overall programs to align short sequences only. We adopt the divide-and-conquer approach to design a memory-efficient algorithm for computing an optimal constrained alignment between two sequences, which greatly reduces the memory requirement of the dynamic programming approaches at the expense of a small constant factor in CPU time. This new algorithm consumes only O(alphan) space, where alpha is the sum of the lengths of constraints and usually alpha &lt; n in practical applications. Based on this algorithm, we have developed a memory-efficient tool for multiple sequence alignment with constraints. http://genome.life.nctu.edu.tw/MUSICME.

Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is an important task in many biomedical applications. A novel framework for objective evaluation of cell tracking algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell Tracking Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark. The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately. The challenge Web site (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) provides access to the training and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of the training videos. It also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.

Continuing research into the global multiple sequence alignment problem has resulted in more sophisticated and principled alignment methods. Unfortunately these new algorithms often require large amounts of time and memory to run, making it nearly impossible to run these algorithms on large datasets. As a solution, we present two general methods, Crumble and Prune, for breaking a phylogenetic alignment problem into smaller, more tractable sub-problems. We call Crumble and Prune meta-alignment methods because they use existing alignment algorithms and can be used with many current alignment programs. Crumble breaks long alignment problems into shorter sub-problems. Prune divides the phylogenetic tree into a collection of smaller trees to reduce the number of sequences in each alignment problem. These methods are orthogonal: they can be applied together to provide better scaling in terms of sequence length and in sequence depth. Both methods partition the problem such that many of the sub-problems can be solved independently. The results are then combined to form a solution to the full alignment problem. Crumble and Prune each provide a significant performance improvement with little loss of accuracy. In some cases, a gain in accuracy was observed. Crumble and Prune were tested on real and simulated data. Furthermore, we have implemented a system called Job-tree that allows hierarchical sub-problems to be solved in parallel on a compute cluster, significantly shortening the run-time. These methods enabled us to solve gigabase alignment problems. These methods could enable a new generation of biologically realistic alignment algorithms to be applied to real world, large scale alignment problems.

Sequence assembly is a difficult problem whose importance has grown again recently as the cost of sequencing has dramatically dropped. Most new sequence assembly software has started by building a de Bruijn graph, avoiding the overlap-based methods used previously because of the computational cost and complexity of these with very large numbers of short reads. Here, we show how to use suffix array-based methods that have formed the basis of recent very fast sequence mapping algorithms to find overlaps and generate assembly string graphs asymptotically faster than previously described algorithms. Standard overlap assembly methods have time complexity O(N(2)), where N is the sum of the lengths of the reads. We use the Ferragina-Manzini index (FM-index) derived from the Burrows-Wheeler transform to find overlaps of length at least tau among a set of reads. As well as an approach that finds all overlaps then implements transitive reduction to produce a string graph, we show how to output directly only the irreducible overlaps, significantly shrinking memory requirements and reducing compute time to O(N), independent of depth. Overlap-based assembly methods naturally handle mixed length read sets, including capillary reads or long reads promised by the third generation sequencing technologies. The algorithms we present here pave the way for overlap-based assembly approaches to be developed that scale to whole vertebrate genome de novo assembly.

The alignment of multiple protein sequences is a fundamental step in the analysis of biological data. It has traditionally been applied to analyzing protein families for conserved motifs, phylogeny, structural properties, and to improve sensitivity in homology searching. The availability of complete genome sequences has increased the demands on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) programs. Current MSA methods suffer from being either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive to be applied effectively in large-scale comparative genomics. We developed Kalign, a method employing the Wu-Manber string-matching algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of multiple sequence alignment. We compared the speed and accuracy of Kalign to other popular methods using Balibase, Prefab, and a new large test set. Kalign was as accurate as the best other methods on small alignments, but significantly more accurate when aligning large and distantly related sets of sequences. In our comparisons, Kalign was about 10 times faster than ClustalW and, depending on the alignment size, up to 50 times faster than popular iterative methods. Kalign is a fast and robust alignment method. It is especially well suited for the increasingly important task of aligning large numbers of sequences.

Next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have advanced progressively in sequence-based genomic research and novel biological applications with the promise of sequencing DNA at unprecedented speed. These new non-Sanger-based technologies feature several advantages, when compared with traditional sequencing methods in terms of higher sequencing speed, lower per run cost and higher accuracy. However, reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as 454/Roche, ABI/SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa, are usually short, thereby restricting the applications of NGS platforms in genome assembly and annotation. We presented an overview of the challenges that these novel technologies meet and particularly illustrated various bioinformatics attempts on mapping and assembly for problem solving. We then compared the performance of several programs in these two fields and further provided advices on selecting suitable tools for specific biological applications.Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 16 June 2011; doi:10.1038/jhg.2011.62.

Approaches to Bayesian inference for problems with intractable likelihoods have become increasingly important in recent years. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and &quot;likelihood free&quot; Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are popular methods for tackling inference in these scenarios but such techniques are computationally expensive. In this paper we compare the two approaches to inference, with a particular focus on parameter inference for stochastic kinetic models, widely used in systems biology. Discrete time transition kernels for models of this type are intractable for all but the most trivial systems yet forward simulation is usually straightforward. We discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of each approach whilst considering the computational cost implications and efficiency of these techniques. In order to explore the properties of each approach we examine a range of observation regimes using two example models. We use a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to explore the impact of full or partial species observations using various time course observations under the assumption of known and unknown measurement error. Further investigation into the impact of observation error is then made using a Schlögl system, a test case which exhibits bi-modal state stability in some regions of parameter space.

12.4064	34.5509	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22759417	candidate	Consensus properties for the deep coalescence problem and their application for scalable tree search.	To infer a species phylogeny from unlinked genes, phylogenetic inference methods must confront the biological processes that create incongruence between gene trees and the species phylogeny. Intra-specific gene variation in ancestral species can result in deep coalescence, also known as incomplete lineage sorting, which creates incongruence between gene trees and the species tree. One approach to account for deep coalescence in phylogenetic analyses is the deep coalescence problem, which takes a collection of gene trees and seeks the species tree that implies the fewest deep coalescence events. Although this approach is promising for phylogenetics, the consensus properties of this problem are mostly unknown and analyses of large data sets may be computationally prohibitive. We prove that the deep coalescence consensus tree problem satisfies the highly desirable Pareto property for clusters (clades). That is, in all instances, each cluster that is present in all of the input gene trees, called a consensus cluster, will also be found in every optimal solution. Moreover, we introduce a new divide and conquer method for the deep coalescence problem based on the Pareto property. This method refines the strict consensus of the input gene trees, thereby, in practice, often greatly reducing the complexity of the tree search and guaranteeing that the estimated species tree will satisfy the Pareto property. Analyses of both simulated and empirical data sets demonstrate that the divide and conquer method can greatly improve upon the speed of heuristics that do not consider the Pareto consensus property, while also guaranteeing that the proposed solution fulfills the Pareto property. The divide and conquer method extends the utility of the deep coalescence problem to data sets with enormous numbers of taxa. 
211.1518	582.1228	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22132132	training	RAxML and FastTree: comparing two methods for large-scale maximum likelihood phylogeny estimation.	Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML. 
53.3811	31.7709	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21984754	candidate	FastSP: linear time calculation of alignment accuracy.	Multiple sequence alignment is a basic part of much biological research, including phylogeny estimation and protein structure and function prediction. Different alignments on the same set of unaligned sequences are often compared, sometimes in order to assess the accuracy of alignment methods or to infer a consensus alignment from a set of estimated alignments. Three of the standard techniques for comparing alignments, Developer, Modeler and Total Column (TC) scores can be derived through calculations of the set of homologies that the alignments share. However, the brute-force technique for calculating this set is quadratic in the input size. The remaining standard technique, Cline Shift Score, inherently requires quadratic time. In this article, we prove that each of these scores can be computed in linear time, and we present FastSP, a linear-time algorithm for calculating these scores. Even on the largest alignments we explored (one with 50 000 sequences), FastSP completed &lt;2 min and used at most 2 GB of the main memory. The best alternative is qscore, a method whose empirical running time is approximately the same as FastSP when given sufficient memory (at least 8 GB), but whose asymptotic running time has never been theoretically established. In addition, for comparisons of large alignments under lower memory conditions (at most 4 GB of main memory), qscore uses substantial memory (up to 10 GB for the datasets we studied), took more time and failed to analyze the largest datasets.

Transcriptome reconstruction is an important application of RNA-Seq, providing critical information for further analysis of transcriptome. Although RNA-Seq offers the potential to identify the whole picture of transcriptome, it still presents special challenges. To handle these difficulties and reconstruct transcriptome as completely as possible, current computational approaches mainly employ two strategies: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. In order to find the similarities and differences between them, we firstly chose five representative assemblers belonging to the two classes respectively, and then investigated and compared their algorithm features in theory and real performances in practice. We found that all the methods can be reduced to graph reduction problems, yet they have different conceptual and practical implementations, thus each assembly method has its specific advantages and disadvantages, performing worse than others in certain aspects while outperforming others in anther aspects at the same time. Finally we merged assemblies of the five assemblers and obtained a much better assembly. Additionally we evaluated an assembler using genome-guided de novo assembly approach, and achieved good performance. Based on these results, we suggest that to obtain a comprehensive set of recovered transcripts, it is better to use a combination of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly.

As the invention of DNA sequencing in the 70s, computational biologists have had to deal with the problem of de novo genome assembly with limited (or insufficient) depth of sequencing. In this work, we investigate the opposite problem, that is, the challenge of dealing with excessive depth of sequencing. We explore the effect of ultra-deep sequencing data in two domains: (i) the problem of decoding reads to bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (in the context of the combinatorial pooling design we have recently proposed), and (ii) the problem of de novo assembly of BAC clones. Using real ultra-deep sequencing data, we show that when the depth of sequencing increases over a certain threshold, sequencing errors make these two problems harder and harder (instead of easier, as one would expect with error-free data), and as a consequence the quality of the solution degrades with more and more data. For the first problem, we propose an effective solution based on 'divide and conquer': we 'slice' a large dataset into smaller samples of optimal size, decode each slice independently, and then merge the results. Experimental results on over 15 000 barley BACs and over 4000 cowpea BACs demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of the decoding and the final assembly. For the second problem, we show for the first time that modern de novo assemblers cannot take advantage of ultra-deep sequencing data.

76.2854	46.5038	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16049194	checked	Assessment of protein distance measures and tree-building methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.	Distance-based methods are popular for reconstructing evolutionary trees of protein sequences, mainly because of their speed and generality. A number of variants of the classical neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm have been proposed, as well as a number of methods to estimate protein distances. We here present a large-scale assessment of performance in reconstructing the correct tree topology for the most popular algorithms. The programs BIONJ, FastME, Weighbor, and standard NJ were run using 12 distance estimators, producing 48 tree-building/distance estimation method combinations. These were evaluated on a test set based on real trees taken from 100 Pfam families. Each tree was used to generate multiple sequence alignments with the ROSE program using three evolutionary models. The accuracy of each method was analyzed as a function of both sequence divergence and location in the tree. We found that BIONJ produced the overall best results, although the average accuracy differed little between the tree-building methods (normally less than 1%). A noticeable trend was that FastME performed poorer than the rest on long branches. Weighbor was several orders of magnitude slower than the other programs. Larger differences were observed when using different distance estimators. Protein-adapted Jukes-Cantor and Kimura distance correction produced clearly poorer results than the other methods, even worse than uncorrected distances. We also assessed the recently developed Scoredist measure, which performed equally well as more complex methods.

5.3918	22.8572	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22809309	candidate	A fast method for large-scale multichromosomal breakpoint median problems.	We provide a computationally realistic mathematical framework for the NP-hard problem of the multichromosomal breakpoint median for linear genomes that can be used in constructing phylogenies. A novel approach is provided that can handle signed, unsigned, and partially signed cases of the multichromosomal breakpoint median problem. Our method provides an avenue for incorporating biological assumptions (whenever available) such as the number of chromosomes in the ancestor, and thus it can be tailored to obtain a more biologically relevant picture of the median. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method by performing an empirical study on both simulated and real data with a comparison to other methods. 
4.7754	44.1066	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10529083	checked	An experimental comparison of neural algorithms for independent component analysis and blind separation.	In this paper, we compare the performance of five prominent neural or adaptive algorithms designed for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and blind source separation (BSS). In the first part of the study, we use artificial data for comparing the accuracy, convergence speed, computational load, and other relevant properties of the algorithms. In the second part, the algorithms are applied to three different real-world data sets. The task is either blind source separation or finding interesting directions in the data for visualisation purposes. We develop criteria for selecting the most meaningful basis vectors of ICA and measuring the quality of the results. The comparison reveals characteristic differences between the studied ICA algorithms. The most important conclusions of our comparison are robustness of the ICA algorithms with respect to modest modeling imperfections, and the superiority of fixed-point algorithms with respect to the computational load.

The introduction of next-generation sequencing techniques and especially the high-throughput systems Solexa (Illumina Inc.) and SOLiD (ABI) made the mapping of short reads to reference sequences a standard application in modern bioinformatics. Short-read alignment is needed for reference based re-sequencing of complete genomes as well as for gene expression analysis based on transcriptome sequencing. Several approaches were developed during the last years allowing for a fast alignment of short sequences to a given template. Methods available to date use heuristic techniques to gain a speedup of the alignments, thereby missing possible alignment positions. Furthermore, most approaches return only one best hit for every query sequence, thus losing the potentially valuable information of alternative alignment positions with identical scores. We developed SARUMAN (Semiglobal Alignment of short Reads Using CUDA and NeedleMAN-Wunsch), a mapping approach that returns all possible alignment positions of a read in a reference sequence under a given error threshold, together with one optimal alignment for each of these positions. Alignments are computed in parallel on graphics hardware, facilitating an considerable speedup of this normally time-consuming step. Combining our filter algorithm with CUDA-accelerated alignments, we were able to align reads to microbial genomes in time comparable or even faster than all published approaches, while still providing an exact, complete and optimal result. At the same time, SARUMAN runs on every standard Linux PC with a CUDA-compatible graphics accelerator. http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/brf/saruman/saruman.html. 
18.8773	18.8112	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17224043	candidate	Efficient classification of complete parameter regions based on semidefinite programming.	Current approaches to parameter estimation are often inappropriate or inconvenient for the modelling of complex biological systems. For systems described by nonlinear equations, the conventional approach is to first numerically integrate the model, and then, in a second a posteriori step, check for consistency with experimental constraints. Hence, only single parameter sets can be considered at a time. Consequently, it is impossible to conclude that the &quot;best&quot; solution was identified or that no good solution exists, because parameter spaces typically cannot be explored in a reasonable amount of time. We introduce a novel approach based on semidefinite programming to directly identify consistent steady state concentrations for systems consisting of mass action kinetics, i.e., polynomial equations and inequality constraints. The duality properties of semidefinite programming allow to rigorously certify infeasibility for whole regions of parameter space, thus enabling the simultaneous multi-dimensional analysis of entire parameter sets. Our algorithm reduces the computational effort of parameter estimation by several orders of magnitude, as illustrated through conceptual sample problems. Of particular relevance for systems biology, the approach can discriminate between structurally different candidate models by proving inconsistency with the available data. 
32.7216	3.9692	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25577371	candidate	A simple protocol for the inference of RNA global pairwise alignments.	RNA alignment is an important step in the annotation and characterization of unknown RNAs, and several methods have been developed to meet the need of fast and accurate alignments. Being the performances of the aligning methods affected by the input RNA features, finding the most suitable method is not trivial. Indeed, no available method clearly outperforms the others. Here we present a simple workflow to help choosing the more suitable method for RNA pairwise alignment. We tested the performances of six algorithms, based on different approaches, on datasets created by merging publicly available datasets of known or curated RNA secondary structure annotations with datasets of curated RNA alignments. Then, we simulated the frequent case where the secondary structure is unknown by using the same alignment datasets but ignoring the known structure and instead predicting it. In conclusion, the proposed workflow for pairwise RNA alignment depends on the input RNA primary sequence identity and the availability of reliable secondary structures. 
12.0504	19.9277	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17127215	candidate	Evaluation of six methods for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates.	Methods for estimating synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates among protein-coding sequences adopt different mutation (substitution) models with subtle yet significant differences, which lead to different estimates of evolutionary information. Little attention has been devoted to the comparison of methods for obtaining reliable estimates since the amount of sequence variations within targeted datasets is always unpredictable. To our knowledge, there is little information available in literature about evaluation of these different methods. In this study, we compared six widely used methods and provided with evaluation results using simulated sequences. The results indicate that incorporating sequence features (such as transition/transversion bias and nucleotide/codon frequency bias) into methods could yield better performance. We recommend that conclusions related to or derived from Ka and Ks analyses should not be readily drawn only according to results from one method. 
40.3904	19.6771	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24639164	candidate	RNA structural alignments, part I: Sankoff-based approaches for structural alignments.	Simultaneous alignment and secondary structure prediction of RNA sequences is often referred to as &quot;RNA structural alignment.&quot; A class of the methods for structural alignment is based on the principles proposed by Sankoff more than 25 years ago. The Sankoff algorithm simultaneously folds and aligns two or more sequences. The advantage of this algorithm over those that separate the folding and alignment steps is that it makes better predictions. The disadvantage is that it is slower and requires more computer memory to run. The amount of computational resources needed to run the Sankoff algorithm is so high that it took more than a decade before the first implementation of a Sankoff style algorithm was published. However, with the faster computers available today and the improved heuristics used in the implementations the Sankoff-based methods have become practical. This chapter describes the methods based on the Sankoff algorithm. All the practical implementations of the algorithm use heuristics to make them run in reasonable time and memory. These heuristics are also described in this chapter.

Recent studies in human genomes have demonstrated the use of de novo assemblies to identify genetic variations that are difficult for mapping-based approaches. Construction of multiple human genome assemblies is enabled by massively parallel sequencing, but a conventional bioinformatics solution is costly and slow, creating bottlenecks in the process. This review describes two public short-read de novo assembly applications that can handle human genomes, ABySS and SOAPdenovo. It also discusses the technical aspects and future challenges of human genome de novo assembly by short reads. 
17.6959	24.2041	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17277416	checked	Accuracy assessment of diploid consensus sequences.	If the origins of fragments are known in genome sequencing projects, it is straightforward to reconstruct diploid consensus sequences. In reality, however, this is not true. Although there are proposed methods to reconstruct haplotypes from genome sequencing projects, an accuracy assessment is required to evaluate the confidence of the estimated diploid consensus sequences. In this paper, we define the confidence score of diploid consensus sequences. It requires the calculation of the likelihood of an assembly. To calculate the likelihood, we propose a linear time algorithm with respect to the number of polymorphic sites. The likelihood calculation and confidence score are used for further improvements of haplotype estimation in two directions. One direction is that low-scored phases are disconnected. The other direction is that, instead of using nominal frequency 1/2, the haplotype frequency is estimated to reflect the actual contribution of each haplotype. Our method was evaluated on the simulated data whose polymorphism rate (1.2 percent) was based on Ciona intestinalis. As a result, the high accuracy of our algorithm was indicated: The true positive rate of the haplotype estimation was greater than 97 percent. 
73.3854	75.4913	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15758203	checked	Evaluating the performance of a successive-approximations approach to parameter optimization in maximum-likelihood phylogeny estimation.	Almost all studies that estimate phylogenies from DNA sequence data under the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion employ an approximate approach. Most commonly, model parameters are estimated on some initial phylogenetic estimate derived using a rapid method (neighbor-joining or parsimony). Parameters are then held constant during a tree search, and ideally, the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved. However, the effectiveness of this approximation has not been formally assessed, in part because doing so requires computationally intensive, full-optimization analyses. Here, we report both indirect and direct evaluations of the effectiveness of successive approximations. We obtained an indirect evaluation by comparing the results of replicate runs on real data that use random trees to provide initial parameter estimates. For six real data sets taken from the literature, all replicate iterative searches converged to the same joint estimates of topology and model parameters, suggesting that the approximation is not starting-point dependent, as long as the heuristic searches of tree space are rigorous. We conducted a more direct assessment using simulations in which we compared the accuracy of phylogenies estimated using full optimization of all model parameters on each tree evaluated to the accuracy of trees estimated via successive approximations. There is no significant difference between the accuracy of the approximation searches relative to full-optimization searches. Our results demonstrate that successive approximation is reliable and provide reassurance that this much faster approach is safe to use for ML estimation of topology.

8.2013	5.3163	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23212387	candidate	A fast and accurate SNP detection algorithm for next-generation sequencing data.	Various methods have been developed for calling single-nucleotide polymorphisms from next-generation sequencing data. However, for satisfactory performance, most of these methods require expensive high-depth sequencing. Here, we propose a fast and accurate single-nucleotide polymorphism detection program that uses a binomial distribution-based algorithm and a mutation probability. We extensively assess this program on normal and cancer next-generation sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas project and pooled data from the 1,000 Genomes Project. We also compare the performance of several state-of-the-art programs for single-nucleotide polymorphism calling and evaluate their pros and cons. We demonstrate that our program is a fast and highly accurate single-nucleotide polymorphism detection method, particularly when the sequence depth is low. The program can finish single-nucleotide polymorphism calling within four hours for 10-fold human genome next-generation sequencing data (30 gigabases) on a standard desktop computer. 
48.1046	29.2121	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063651	candidate	BitMapper: an efficient all-mapper based on bit-vector computing.	As the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies producing hundreds of millions of reads every day, a tremendous computational challenge is to map NGS reads to a given reference genome efficiently. However, existing methods of all-mappers, which aim at finding all mapping locations of each read, are very time consuming. The majority of existing all-mappers consist of 2 main parts, filtration and verification. This work significantly reduces verification time, which is the dominant part of the running time. An efficient all-mapper, BitMapper, is developed based on a new vectorized bit-vector algorithm, which simultaneously calculates the edit distance of one read to multiple locations in a given reference genome. Experimental results on both simulated and real data sets show that BitMapper is from several times to an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art all-mappers, while achieving higher sensitivity, i.e., better quality solutions. We present BitMapper, which is designed to return all mapping locations of raw reads containing indels as well as mismatches. BitMapper is implemented in C under a GPL license.

Ongoing improvements in throughput of the next-generation sequencing technologies challenge the current generation of de novo sequence assemblers. Most recent sequence assemblers are based on the construction of a de Bruijn graph. An alternative framework of growing interest is the assembly string graph, not necessitating a division of the reads into k-mers, but requiring fast algorithms for the computation of suffix-prefix matches among all pairs of reads. Here we present efficient methods for the construction of a string graph from a set of sequencing reads. Our approach employs suffix sorting and scanning methods to compute suffix-prefix matches. Transitive edges are recognized and eliminated early in the process and the graph is efficiently constructed including irreducible edges only. Our suffix-prefix match determination and string graph construction algorithms have been implemented in the software package Readjoiner. Comparison with existing string graph-based assemblers shows that Readjoiner is faster and more space efficient. Readjoiner is available at http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/readjoiner. 
33.5196	47.7978	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833741	checked	Fast and consistent estimation of species trees using supermatrix rooted triples.	Concatenated sequence alignments are often used to infer species-level relationships. Previous studies have shown that analysis of concatenated data using maximum likelihood (ML) can produce misleading results when loci have differing gene tree topologies due to incomplete lineage sorting. Here, we develop a polynomial time method that utilizes the modified mincut supertree algorithm to construct an estimated species tree from inferred rooted triples of concatenated alignments. We term this method SuperMatrix Rooted Triple (SMRT) and use the notation SMRT-ML when rooted triples are inferred by ML. We use simulations to investigate the performance of SMRT-ML under Jukes-Cantor and general time-reversible substitution models for four- and five-taxon species trees and also apply the method to an empirical data set of yeast genes. We find that SMRT-ML converges to the correct species tree in many cases in which ML on the full concatenated data set fails to do so. SMRT-ML can be conservative in that its output tree is often partially unresolved for problematic clades. We show analytically that when the species tree is clocklike and mutations occur under the Cavender-Farris-Neyman substitution model, as the number of genes increases, SMRT-ML is increasingly likely to infer the correct species tree even when the most likely gene tree does not match the species tree. SMRT-ML is therefore a computationally efficient and statistically consistent estimator of the species tree when gene trees are distributed according to the multispecies coalescent model.

Multiple sequence alignment is one of the dominant problems in computational molecular biology. Numerous scoring functions and methods have been proposed, most of which result in NP-hard problems. In this paper we propose for the first time a general formulation for multiple alignment with arbitrary gap-costs based on an integer linear program (ILP). In addition we describe a branch-and-cut algorithm to effectively solve the ILP to optimality. We evaluate the performances of our approach in terms of running time and quality of the alignments using the BAliBase database of reference alignments. The results show that our implementation ranks amongst the best programs developed so far. 
49.5105	17.8038	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174280	candidate	SEPP: SATé-enabled phylogenetic placement.	We address the problem of Phylogenetic Placement, in which the objective is to insert short molecular sequences (called query sequences) into an existing phylogenetic tree and alignment on full-length sequences for the same gene. Phylogenetic placement has the potential to provide information beyond pure &quot;species identification&quot; (i.e., the association of metagenomic reads to existing species), because it can also give information about the evolutionary relationships between these query sequences and to known species. Approaches for phylogenetic placement have been developed that operate in two steps: first, an alignment is estimated for each query sequence to the alignment of the full-length sequences, and then that alignment is used to find the optimal location in the phylogenetic tree for the query sequence. Recent methods of this type include HMMALIGN+EPA, HMMALIGN+pplacer, and PaPaRa+EPA.We report on a study evaluating phylogenetic placement methods on biological and simulated data. This study shows that these methods have extremely good accuracy and computational tractability under conditions where the input contains a highly accurate alignment and tree for the full-length sequences, and the set of full-length sequences is sufficiently small and not too evolutionarily diverse; however, we also show that under other conditions accuracy declines and the computational requirements for memory and time exceed acceptable limits. We present SEPP, a general &quot;boosting&quot; technique to improve the accuracy and/or speed of phylogenetic placement techniques. The key algorithmic aspect of this booster is a dataset decomposition technique in SATé, a method that utilizes an iterative divide-and-conquer technique to co-estimate alignments and trees on large molecular sequence datasets. We show that SATé-boosting improves HMMALIGN+pplacer, placing short sequences more accurately when the set of input sequences has a large evolutionary diameter and produces placements of comparable accuracy in a fraction of the time for easier cases. SEPP software and the datasets used in this study are all available for free at http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/sepp/submission.

Our ability to construct very large phylogenetic trees is becoming more important as vast amounts of sequence data are becoming readily available. Neighbor joining (NJ) is a widely used distance-based phylogenetic tree construction method that has historically been considered fast, but it is prohibitively slow for building trees from increasingly large datasets. We developed a fast variant of NJ called relaxed neighbor joining (RNJ) and performed experiments to measure the speed improvement over NJ. Since repeated runs of the RNJ algorithm generate a superset of the trees that repeated NJ runs generate, we also assessed tree quality. RNJ is dramatically faster than NJ, and the quality of resulting trees is very similar for the two algorithms. The results indicate that RNJ is a reasonable alternative to NJ and that it is especially well suited for uses that involve large numbers of taxa or highly repetitive procedures such as bootstrapping.

In structural alignments of RNA sequences, the computational cost of Sankoff algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes the score of the common secondary structure and the score of the alignment, is too high for long sequences (O(L (6)) time for two sequences of length L). In this chapter, we introduce the methods that predict the structures and the alignment separately to avoid the heavy computations in Sankoff algorithm. In those methods, neither of those two prediction processes is independent, but each of them utilizes the information of the other process. The first process typically includes prediction of base-pairing probabilities (BPPs) or the candidates of the stems, and the alignment process utilizes those results. At the same time, it is also important to reflect the information of the alignment to the structure prediction. This idea can be implemented as the probabilistic transformation (PCT) of BPPs using the potential alignment. As same as for all the estimation problems, it is important to define the evaluation measure for the structural alignment. The principle of maximum expected accuracy (MEA) is applicable for sum-of-pairs (SPS) score based on the reference alignment. 
16.5700	5.8768	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16403792	candidate	A greedier approach for finding tag SNPs.	Recent studies have shown that a small subset of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (called tag SNPs) is sufficient to capture the haplotype patterns in a high linkage disequilibrium region. To find the minimum set of tag SNPs, exact algorithms for finding the optimal solution could take exponential time. On the other hand, approximation algorithms are more efficient but may fail to find the optimal solution. We propose a hybrid method that combines the ideas of the branch-and-bound method and the greedy algorithm. This method explores larger solution space to obtain a better solution than a traditional greedy algorithm. It also allows the user to adjust the efficiency of the program and quality of solutions. This algorithm has been implemented and tested on a variety of simulated and biological data. The experimental results indicate that our program can find better solutions than previous methods. This approach is quite general since it can be used to adapt other greedy algorithms to solve their corresponding problems. The program is available upon request. 
375.1588	842.8429	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24708189	training	Comparison of mapping algorithms used in high-throughput sequencing: application to Ion Torrent data.	The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in HTS data analysis is the mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of evaluating mapping algorithms. In this paper, we present a benchmark procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in HTS using both real and simulated datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed CuReSim, a new read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of HTS technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. CuReSim and CuReSimEval, a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the CuReSim simulated reads, are freely available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a comparison has not yet been established. A benchmark procedure to compare HTS data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing platform. 
29.0583	16.0399	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16362903	candidate	Improvement in the accuracy of multiple sequence alignment program MAFFT.	In 2002, we developed and released a rapid multiple sequence alignment program MAFFT that was designed to handle a huge (up to approximately 5,000 sequences) and long data (approximately 2,000 aa or approximately 5,000 nt) in a reasonable time on a standard desktop PC. As for the accuracy, however, the previous versions (v.4 and lower) of MAFFT were outperformed by ProbCons and TCoffee v.2, both of which were released in 2004, in several benchmark tests. Here we report a recent extension of MAFFT that aims to improve the accuracy with as little cost of calculation time as possible. The extended version of MAFFT (v.5) has new iterative refinement options, G-INS-i and L-INS-i (collectively denoted as [GL]-INS-i in this report). These options use a new objective function combining the weighted sum-of-pairs (WSP) score and a score similar to COFFEE derived from all pairwise alignments. We discuss the improvement in accuracy brought by this extension, mainly using two benchmark tests released very recently, BAliBASE v.3 (for protein alignments) and BRAliBASE (for RNA alignments). According to BAliBASE v.3, the overall average accuracy of L-INS-i was higher than those of other methods successively released in 2004, although the difference among the most accurate methods (ProbCons, TCoffee v.2 and new options of MAFFT) was small. The advantage in accuracy of [GL]-INS-i became greater for the alignments consisting of approximately 50-100 sequences. By utilizing this feature of MAFFT, we also examined another possible approach to improve the accuracy by incorporating homolog information collected from database. The [GL]-INS-i options are applicable to aligning up to approximately 200 sequences, although not applicable to thousands of sequences because of time and space complexities.

Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads &gt;200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net

The advent of digital computers has made the routine use of pattern-matching possible in various applications. This has also stimulated the development of many algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that offers improved performance compared to those reported in the literature so far. The new algorithm has been evolved after analyzing the well-known algorithms such as Boyer-Moore, Quick-search, Raita, and Horspool. The overall performance of the proposed algorithm has been improved using the shift provided by the Quick-search bad-character and by defining a fixed order of comparison. These result in the reduction of the character comparison effort at each attempt. The best- and the worst- case time complexities are also presented in this paper. Most importantly, the proposed method has been compared with the other widely used algorithms. It is interesting to note that the new algorithm works consistently better for any alphabet size. 
82.8832	7.2251	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12015885	candidate	A structural EM algorithm for phylogenetic inference.	A central task in the study of molecular evolution is the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree from sequences of current-day taxa. The most established approach to tree reconstruction is maximum likelihood (ML) analysis. Unfortunately, searching for the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree is computationally prohibitive for large data sets. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm that uses Structural Expectation Maximization (EM) for learning maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. This algorithm is similar to the standard EM method for edge-length estimation, except that during iterations of the Structural EM algorithm the topology is improved as well as the edge length. Our algorithm performs iterations of two steps. In the E-step, we use the current tree topology and edge lengths to compute expected sufficient statistics, which summarize the data. In the M-Step, we search for a topology that maximizes the likelihood with respect to these expected sufficient statistics. We show that searching for better topologies inside the M-step can be done efficiently, as opposed to standard methods for topology search. We prove that each iteration of this procedure increases the likelihood of the topology, and thus the procedure must converge. This convergence point, however, can be a suboptimal one. To escape from such &quot;local optima,&quot; we further enhance our basic EM procedure by incorporating moves in the flavor of simulated annealing. We evaluate these new algorithms on both synthetic and real sequence data and show that for protein sequences even our basic algorithm finds more plausible trees than existing methods for searching maximum likelihood phylogenies. Furthermore, our algorithms are dramatically faster than such methods, enabling, for the first time, phylogenetic analysis of large protein data sets in the maximum likelihood framework.

The problem is NP-hard. The full dynamic programming takes too much time. The progressive alignment heuristics adopted by most state-of-the-art works suffer from the &quot;once a gap, always a gap&quot; phenomenon. Is there a radically new way to do multiple sequence alignment? In this paper, we introduce a novel and orthogonal multiple sequence alignment method, using both multiple optimized spaced seeds and new algorithms to handle these seeds efficiently. Our new algorithm processes information of all sequences as a whole and tries to build the alignment vertically, avoiding problems caused by the popular progressive approaches. Because the optimized spaced seeds have proved significantly more sensitive than the consecutive k-mers, the new approach promises to be more accurate and reliable. To validate our new approach, we have implemented MANGO: Multiple Alignment with N Gapped Oligos. Experiments were carried out on large 16S RNA benchmarks, showing that MANGO compares favorably, in both accuracy and speed, against state-of-the-art multiple sequence alignment methods, including ClustalW 1.83, MUSCLE 3.6, MAFFT 5.861, ProbConsRNA 1.11, Dialign 2.2.1, DIALIGN-T 0.2.1, T-Coffee 4.85, POA 2.0, and Kalign 2.0.

0.2539	19.9957	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15483331	candidate	Different versions of the Dayhoff rate matrix.	Many phylogenetic inference methods are based on Markov models of sequence evolution. These are usually expressed in terms of a matrix (Q) of instantaneous rates of change but some models of amino acid replacement, most notably the PAM model of Dayhoff and colleagues, were originally published only in terms of time-dependent probability matrices (P(t)). Previously published methods for deriving Q have used eigen-decomposition of an approximation to P(t). We show that the commonly used value of t is too large to ensure convergence of the estimates of elements of Q. We describe two simpler alternative methods for deriving Q from information such as that published by Dayhoff and colleagues. Neither of these methods requires approximation or eigen-decomposition. We identify the methods used to derive various different versions of the Dayhoff model in current software, perform a comparison of existing and new implementations, and, to facilitate agreement among scientists using supposedly identical models, recommend that one of the new methods be used as a standard. 
22.0061	21.7867	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22457070	candidate	A mostly traditional approach improves alignment of bisulfite-converted DNA.	Cytosines in genomic DNA are sometimes methylated. This affects many biological processes and diseases. The standard way of measuring methylation is to use bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to thymines, then sequence the DNA and compare it to a reference genome sequence. We describe a method for the critical step of aligning the DNA reads to the correct genomic locations. Our method builds on classic alignment techniques, including likelihood-ratio scores and spaced seeds. In a realistic benchmark, our method has a better combination of sensitivity, specificity and speed than nine other high-throughput bisulfite aligners. This study enables more accurate and rational analysis of DNA methylation. It also illustrates how to adapt general-purpose alignment methods to a special case with distorted base patterns: this should be informative for other special cases such as ancient DNA and AT-rich genomes. 
37.9191	20.9221	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147201	candidate	Comparing programs and methods to use for global multiple sequence alignment.	It is difficult to find a global optimal alignment of more than two sequences (and, especially, more than three) that includes matches, mismatches, and gaps and that takes into account the degree of variation in all of the sequences at the same time. Thus, approximate methods are used, such as progressive global alignment, iterative global alignment, alignments based on locally conserved patterns found in the same order in the sequences, statistical methods that generate probabilistic models of the sequences, and multiple sequence alignments produced by graph-based methods. When 10 or more sequences are being compared, it is common to begin by determining sequence similarities between all pairs of sequences in the set. A variety of methods are then available to cluster the sequences into the most related groups or into a phylogenetic tree. This article discusses several of these methods and provides data that compare their utility under various conditions. 
63.1572	2.1234	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20298584	candidate	MISHIMA--a new method for high speed multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences of bacterial genome scale data.	Large nucleotide sequence datasets are becoming increasingly common objects of comparison. Complete bacterial genomes are reported almost everyday. This creates challenges for developing new multiple sequence alignment methods. Conventional multiple alignment methods are based on pairwise alignment and/or progressive alignment techniques. These approaches have performance problems when the number of sequences is large and when dealing with genome scale sequences. We present a new method of multiple sequence alignment, called MISHIMA (Method for Inferring Sequence History In terms of Multiple Alignment), that does not depend on pairwise sequence comparison. A new algorithm is used to quickly find rare oligonucleotide sequences shared by all sequences. Divide and conquer approach is then applied to break the sequences into fragments that can be aligned independently by an external alignment program. These partial alignments are assembled together to form a complete alignment of the original sequences. MISHIMA provides improved performance compared to the commonly used multiple alignment methods. As an example, six complete genome sequences of bacteria species Helicobacter pylori (about 1.7 Mb each) were successfully aligned in about 6 hours using a single PC. 
35.6939	1.5873	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26051265	candidate	Fast randomized approximate string matching with succinct hash data structures.	The high throughput of modern NGS sequencers coupled with the huge sizes of genomes currently analysed, poses always higher algorithmic challenges to align short reads quickly and accurately against a reference sequence. A crucial, additional, requirement is that the data structures used should be light. The available modern solutions usually are a compromise between the mentioned constraints: in particular, indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform offer reduced memory requirements at the price of lower sensitivity, while hash-based text indexes guarantee high sensitivity at the price of significant memory consumption. In this work we describe a technique that permits to attain the advantages granted by both classes of indexes. This is achieved using Hamming-aware hash functions--hash functions designed to search the entire Hamming sphere in reduced time--which are also homomorphisms on de Bruijn graphs. We show that, using this particular class of hash functions, the corresponding hash index can be represented in linear space introducing only a logarithmic slowdown (in the query length) for the lookup operation. We point out that our data structure reaches its goals without compressing its input: another positive feature, as in biological applications data is often very close to be un-compressible. The new data structure introduced in this work is called dB-hash and we show how its implementation--BW-ERNE--maintains the high sensitivity and speed of its (hash-based) predecessor ERNE, while drastically reducing space consumption. Extensive comparison experiments conducted with several popular alignment tools on both simulated and real NGS data, show, finally, that BW-ERNE is able to attain both the positive features of succinct data structures (that is, small space) and hash indexes (that is, sensitivity). In applications where space and speed are both a concern, standard methods often sacrifice accuracy to obtain competitive throughputs and memory footprints. In this work we show that, combining hashing and succinct indexing techniques, we can attain good performances and accuracy with a memory footprint comparable to that of the most popular compressed indexes. 
13.9791	5.3632	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12376373	candidate	Optimal algorithms for local vertex quartet cleaning.	Reconstructing evolutionary trees is an important problem in biology. A response to the computational intractability of most of the traditional criteria for inferring evolutionary trees has been a focus on new criteria, particularly quartet-based methods that seek to merge trees derived on subsets of four species from a given species-set into a tree for that entire set. Unfortunately, most of these methods are very sensitive to errors in the reconstruction of the trees for individual quartets of species. A recently developed technique called quartet cleaning can alleviate this difficulty in certain cases by using redundant information in the complete set of quartet topologies for a given species-set to correct such errors. In this paper, we describe two new local vertex quartet cleaning algorithms which have optimal time complexity and error-correction bound, respectively. These are the first known local vertex quartet cleaning algorithms that are optimal with respect to either of these attributes.

Mate pair library sequencing is an effective and economical method for detecting genomic structural variants and chromosomal abnormalities. Unfortunately, the mapping and alignment of mate-pair read pairs to a reference genome is a challenging and time-consuming process for most next-generation sequencing alignment programs. Large insert sizes, introduction of library preparation protocol artifacts (biotin junction reads, paired-end read contamination, chimeras, etc.) and presence of structural variant breakpoints within reads increase mapping and alignment complexity. We describe an algorithm that is up to 20 times faster and 25% more accurate than popular next-generation sequencing alignment programs when processing mate pair sequencing. 
35.8373	11.2059	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18215258	candidate	A fast structural multiple alignment method for long RNA sequences.	Aligning multiple RNA sequences is essential for analyzing non-coding RNAs. Although many alignment methods for non-coding RNAs, including Sankoff's algorithm for strict structural alignments, have been proposed, they are either inaccurate or computationally too expensive. Faster methods with reasonable accuracies are required for genome-scale analyses. We propose a fast algorithm for multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences that is an extension of our pairwise structural alignment method (implemented in SCARNA). The accuracies of the implemented software, MXSCARNA, are at least as favorable as those of state-of-art algorithms that are computationally much more expensive in time and memory. The proposed method for structural alignment of multiple RNA sequences is fast enough for large-scale analyses with accuracies at least comparable to those of existing algorithms. The source code of MXSCARNA and its web server are available at http://mxscarna.ncrna.org.

PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing is a third-generation sequencing technique producing long reads, with comparatively lower throughput and higher error rate. Errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream analysis like mapping or de novo assembly. A hybrid strategy that takes advantage of the high accuracy of second-generation short reads has been proposed for correcting long reads. Mapping of short reads on long reads provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99% of errors, however, at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of disk and memory space. We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads, and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads by traversing chosen paths in the graph. In comparison, LoRDEC is at least six times faster and requires at least 93% less memory or disk space than available tools, while achieving comparable accuracy. Availability and implementaion: LoRDEC is written in C++, tested on Linux platforms and freely available at http://atgc.lirmm.fr/lordec.

Next Generation Sequencing is having an extremely strong impact in biological and medical research and diagnostics, with applications ranging from gene expression quantification to genotyping and genome reconstruction. Sequencing data is often provided as raw reads which are processed prior to analysis 1 of the most used preprocessing procedures is read trimming, which aims at removing low quality portions while preserving the longest high quality part of a NGS read. In the current work, we evaluate nine different trimming algorithms in four datasets and three common NGS-based applications (RNA-Seq, SNP calling and genome assembly). Trimming is shown to increase the quality and reliability of the analysis, with concurrent gains in terms of execution time and computational resources needed.

Currently, there are lots of methods to select informative SNPs for haplotype reconstruction. However, there are still some challenges that render them ineffective for large data sets. First, some traditional methods belong to wrappers which are of high computational complexity. Second, some methods ignore linkage disequilibrium that it is hard to interpret selection results. In this study, we innovatively derive optimization criteria by combining two-locus and multilocus LD measure to obtain the criteria of Max-Correlation and Min-Redundancy (MCMR). Then, we use a greedy algorithm to select the candidate set of informative SNPs constrained by the criteria. Finally, we use backward scheme to refine the candidate subset. We separately use small and middle (&gt;1,000 SNPs) data sets to evaluate MCMR in terms of the reconstuction accuracy, the time complexity, and the compactness. Additionally, to demonstrate that MCMR is practical for large data sets, we design a parameter w to adapt to various platforms and introduce another replacement scheme for larger data sets, which sharply narrow down the computational complexity of evaluating the reconstruct ratio. Then, we first apply our method based on haplotype reconstruction for large size (&gt;5,000 SNPs) data sets. The results confirm that MCMR leads to promising improvement in informative SNPs selection and prediction accuracy.

To study gene evolution across a wide range of organisms, biologists need accurate tools for multiple sequence alignment of protein families. Obtaining accurate alignments, however, is a difficult computational problem because of not only the high computational cost but also the lack of proper objective functions for measuring alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic consistency, a novel scoring function for multiple sequence comparisons. We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets. On the BAliBASE, SABmark, and PREFAB benchmark alignment databases, ProbCons achieves statistically significant improvement over other leading methods while maintaining practical speed. ProbCons is publicly available as a Web resource. 
49.1867	31.4798	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775302	candidate	Comparative analysis of RNA-Seq alignment algorithms and the RNA-Seq unified mapper (RUM).	A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously. We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability. The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM). ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu; epierce@mail.med.upenn.edu The RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248. 
2.0693	27.7960	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23573036	candidate	Searching microsatellites in DNA sequences: approaches used and tools developed.	Microsatellite instability associated genomic activities and evolutionary changes have led to a renewed focus on microsatellite research. In last decade, a number of microsatellite mining tools have been introduced based on different computational approaches. The choice is generally made between slow but exhaustive dynamic programming based approaches, or fast and incomplete heuristic methods. Tools based on stochastic approaches are more popular due to their simplicity and added ornamental features. We have performed a comparative evaluation of the relative efficiency of some microsatellite search tools with their default settings. The graphical user interface, the statistical analysis of the output and ability to mine imperfect repeats are the most important criteria in selecting a tool for a particular investigation. However, none of the available tools alone provides complete and accurate information about microsatellites, and a lot depends on the discretion of the user. 
1.2099	23.4154	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23441908	checked	A hybrid short read mapping accelerator.	The rapid growth of short read datasets poses a new challenge to the short read mapping problem in terms of sensitivity and execution speed. Existing methods often use a restrictive error model for computing the alignments to improve speed, whereas more flexible error models are generally too slow for large-scale applications. A number of short read mapping software tools have been proposed. However, designs based on hardware are relatively rare. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been successfully used in a number of specific application areas, such as the DSP and communications domains due to their outstanding parallel data processing capabilities, making them a competitive platform to solve problems that are &quot;inherently parallel&quot;. We present a hybrid system for short read mapping utilizing both FPGA-based hardware and CPU-based software. The computation intensive alignment and the seed generation operations are mapped onto an FPGA. We present a computationally efficient, parallel block-wise alignment structure (Align Core) to approximate the conventional dynamic programming algorithm. The performance is compared to the multi-threaded CPU-based GASSST and BWA software implementations. For single-end alignment, our hybrid system achieves faster processing speed than GASSST (with a similar sensitivity) and BWA (with a higher sensitivity); for pair-end alignment, our design achieves a slightly worse sensitivity than that of BWA but has a higher processing speed. This paper shows that our hybrid system can effectively accelerate the mapping of short reads to a reference genome based on the seed-and-extend approach. The performance comparison to the GASSST and BWA software implementations under different conditions shows that our hybrid design achieves a high degree of sensitivity and requires less overall execution time with only modest FPGA resource utilization. Our hybrid system design also shows that the performance bottleneck for the short read mapping problem can be changed from the alignment stage to the seed generation stage, which provides an additional requirement for the future development of short read aligners. 
60.2303	58.0704	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548751	checked	Accounting for uncertainty in the tree topology has little effect on the decision-theoretic approach to model selection in phylogeny estimation.	Currently available methods for model selection used in phylogenetic analysis are based on an initial fixed-tree topology. Once a model is picked based on this topology, a rigorous search of the tree space is run under that model to find the maximum-likelihood estimate of the tree (topology and branch lengths) and the maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the decision-theoretic (DT) approach that relax the fixed-topology restriction. We also relax the fixed-topology restriction for the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) methods. We compare the performance of the different methods (the relaxed, restricted, and the likelihood-ratio test [LRT]) using simulated data. This comparison is done by evaluating the relative complexity of the models resulting from each method and by comparing the performance of the chosen models in estimating the true tree. We also compare the methods relative to one another by measuring the closeness of the estimated trees corresponding to the different chosen models under these methods. We show that varying the topology does not have a major impact on model choice. We also show that the outcome of the two proposed extensions is identical and is comparable to that of the BIC, Extended-BIC, and DT. Hence, using the simpler methods in choosing a model for analyzing the data is more computationally feasible, with results comparable to the more computationally intensive methods. Another outcome of this study is that earlier conclusions about the DT approach are reinforced. That is, LRT, Extended-AIC, and AIC result in more complicated models that do not contribute to the performance of the phylogenetic inference, yet cause a significant increase in the time required for data analysis.

Next-generation DNA sequencing platforms are capable of generating millions of reads in a matter of days at rapidly reducing costs. Despite its proliferation and technological improvements, the performance of next-generation sequencing remains adversely affected by the imperfections in the underlying biochemical and signal acquisition procedures. To this end, various techniques, including statistical methods, are used to improve read lengths and accuracy of these systems. Development of high performing base calling algorithms that are computationally efficient and scalable is an ongoing challenge. We develop model-based statistical methods for fast and accurate base calling in Illumina's next-generation sequencing platforms. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable parametric model which enables dynamic programming formulation of the base calling problem. Forward-backward and soft-output Viterbi algorithms are developed, and their performance and complexity are investigated and compared with the existing state-of-the-art base calling methods for this platform. A C code implementation of our algorithm named Softy can be downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/dynamicprog. We demonstrate high accuracy and speed of the proposed methods on reads obtained using Illumina's Genome Analyzer II and HiSeq2000. In addition to performing reliable and fast base calling, the developed algorithms enable incorporation of prior knowledge which can be utilized for parameter estimation and is potentially beneficial in various downstream applications. 
33.6854	2.4706	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17573965	candidate	ISHAPE: new rapid and accurate software for haplotyping.	We have developed a new haplotyping program based on the combination of an iterative multiallelic EM algorithm (IEM), bootstrap resampling and a pseudo Gibbs sampler. The use of the IEM-bootstrap procedure considerably reduces the space of possible haplotype configurations to be explored, greatly reducing computation time, while the adaptation of the Gibbs sampler with a recombination model on this restricted space maintains high accuracy. On large SNP datasets (&gt;30 SNPs), we used a segmented approach based on a specific partition-ligation strategy. We compared this software, Ishape (Iterative Segmented HAPlotyping by Em), with reference programs such as Phase, Fastphase, and PL-EM. Analogously with Phase, there are 2 versions of Ishape: Ishape1 which uses a simple coalescence model for the pseudo Gibbs sampler step, and Ishape2 which uses a recombination model instead. We tested the program on 2 types of real SNP datasets derived from Hapmap: adjacent SNPs (high LD) and SNPs spaced by 5 Kb (lower level of LD). In both cases, we tested 100 replicates for each size: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80 SNPs. For adjacent SNPs Ishape2 is superior to the other software both in terms of speed and accuracy. For SNPs spaced by 5 Kb, Ishape2 yields similar results to Phase2.1 in terms of accuracy, and both outperform the other software. In terms of speed, Ishape2 runs about 4 times faster than Phase2.1 with 10 SNPs, and about 10 times faster with 80 SNPs. For the case of 5kb-spaced SNPs, Fastphase may run faster with more than 100 SNPs. These results show that the Ishape heuristic approach for haplotyping is very competitive in terms of accuracy and speed and deserves to be evaluated extensively for possible future widespread use.

One of the key aspects of computational systems biology is the investigation on the dynamic biological processes within cells. Computational models are often required to elucidate the mechanisms and principles driving the processes because of the nonlinearity and complexity. The models usually incorporate a set of parameters that signify the physical properties of the actual biological systems. In most cases, these parameters are estimated by fitting the model outputs with the corresponding experimental data. However, this is a challenging task because the available experimental data are frequently noisy and incomplete. In this paper, a new hybrid optimization method is proposed to estimate these parameters from the noisy and incomplete experimental data. The proposed method, called Swarm-based Chemical Reaction Optimization, integrates the evolutionary searching strategy employed by the Chemical Reaction Optimization, into the neighbouring searching strategy of the Firefly Algorithm method. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated using a simulated nonlinear model and two biological models: synthetic transcriptional oscillators, and extracellular protease production models. The results showed that the accuracy and computational speed of the proposed method were better than the existing Differential Evolution, Firefly Algorithm and Chemical Reaction Optimization methods. The reliability of the estimated parameters was statistically validated, which suggests that the model outputs produced by these parameters were valid even when noisy and incomplete experimental data were used. Additionally, Akaike Information Criterion was employed to evaluate the model selection, which highlighted the capability of the proposed method in choosing a plausible model based on the experimental data. In conclusion, this paper presents the effectiveness of the proposed method for parameter estimation and model selection problems using noisy and incomplete experimental data. This study is hoped to provide a new insight in developing more accurate and reliable biological models based on limited and low quality experimental data. 
97.6178	25.6726	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23267171	candidate	SRmapper: a fast and sensitive genome-hashing alignment tool.	Modern sequencing instruments have the capability to produce millions of short reads every day. The large number of reads produced in conjunction with variations between reads and reference genomic sequences caused both by legitimate differences, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions (indels), and by sequencer errors make alignment a difficult and computationally expensive task, and many reads cannot be aligned. Here, we introduce a new alignment tool, SRmapper, which in tests using real data can align 10s of billions of base pairs from short reads to the human genome per computer processor day. SRmapper tolerates a higher number of mismatches than current programs based on Burrows-Wheeler transform and finds about the same number of alignments in 2-8× less time depending on read length (with higher performance gain for longer read length). The current version of SRmapper aligns both single and pair-end reads in base space fastq format and outputs alignments in Sequence Alignment/Map format. SRmapper uses a probabilistic approach to set a default number of mismatches allowed and determines alignment quality. SRmapper's memory footprint (∼2.5 GB) is small enough that it can be run on a computer with 4 GB of random access memory for a genome the size of a human. Finally, SRmapper is designed so that its function can be extended to finding small indels as well as long deletions and chromosomal translocations in future versions. http://www.umsl.edu/∼wongch/software.html. 
68.5983	5.1945	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11108703	candidate	An iterative method for faster sum-of-pairs multiple sequence alignment.	Multiple sequence alignment is an important tool in computational biology. In order to solve the task of computing multiple alignments in affordable time, the most commonly used multiple alignment methods have to use heuristics. Nevertheless, the computation of optimal multiple alignments is important in its own right, and it provides a means of evaluating heuristic approaches or serves as a subprocedure of heuristic alignment methods. We present an algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer alignment approach together with recent results on search space reduction to speed up the computation of multiple sequence alignments. The method is adaptive in that depending on the time one wants to spend on the alignment, a better, up to optimal alignment can be obtained. To speed up the computation in the optimal alignment step, we apply the alpha(*) algorithm which leads to a procedure provably more efficient than previous exact algorithms. We also describe our implementation of the algorithm and present results showing the effectiveness and limitations of the procedure.

We propose RACER (Rapid and Accurate Correction of Errors in Reads), a new software program for correcting errors in sequencing data.

76.8427	27.2160	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17355623	candidate	Fast computation of distance estimators.	Some distance methods are among the most commonly used methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from sequence data. The input to a distance method is a distance matrix, containing estimated pairwise distances between all pairs of taxa. Distance methods themselves are often fast, e.g., the famous and popular Neighbor Joining (NJ) algorithm reconstructs a phylogeny of n taxa in time O(n3). Unfortunately, the fastest practical algorithms known for Computing the distance matrix, from n sequences of length l, takes time proportional to l.n2. Since the sequence length typically is much larger than the number of taxa, the distance estimation is the bottleneck in phylogeny reconstruction. This bottleneck is especially apparent in reconstruction of large phylogenies or in applications where many trees have to be reconstructed, e.g., bootstrapping and genome wide applications. We give an advanced algorithm for Computing the number of mutational events between DNA sequences which is significantly faster than both Phylip and Paup. Moreover, we give a new method for estimating pairwise distances between sequences which contain ambiguity Symbols. This new method is shown to be more accurate as well as faster than earlier methods. Our novel algorithm for Computing distance estimators provides a valuable tool in phylogeny reconstruction. Since the running time of our distance estimation algorithm is comparable to that of most distance methods, the previous bottleneck is removed. All distance methods, such as NJ, require a distance matrix as input and, hence, our novel algorithm significantly improves the overall running time of all distance methods. In particular, we show for real world biological applications how the running time of phylogeny reconstruction using NJ is improved from a matter of hours to a matter of seconds.

The alignment of short reads generated by next-generation sequencers to genomes is an important problem in many biomedical and bioinformatics applications. Although many proposed methods work very well on narrow ranges of read lengths, they tend to suffer in performance and alignment quality for reads outside of these ranges. We introduce RandAL, a novel method that aligns DNA sequences to reference genomes. Our approach utilizes two FM indices to facilitate efficient bidirectional searching, a pruning heuristic to speed up the computing of edit distances, and most importantly, a randomized strategy that enables effective estimation of key parameters. Extensive comparisons showed that RandAL outperformed popular aligners in most instances and was unique in its consistent and accurate performance over a wide range of read lengths and error rates. The software package is publicly available at https://github.com/namsyvo/RandAL. RandAL promises to align effectively and accurately short reads that come from a variety of technologies with different read lengths and rates of sequencing error. 
70.4572	8.2320	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10964570	candidate	T-Coffee: A novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment.	We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests. 
24.7340	14.2309	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15819989	candidate	Shortest triplet clustering: reconstructing large phylogenies using representative sets.	Understanding the evolutionary relationships among species based on their genetic information is one of the primary objectives in phylogenetic analysis. Reconstructing phylogenies for large data sets is still a challenging task in Bioinformatics. We propose a new distance-based clustering method, the shortest triplet clustering algorithm (STC), to reconstruct phylogenies. The main idea is the introduction of a natural definition of so-called k-representative sets. Based on k-representative sets, shortest triplets are reconstructed and serve as building blocks for the STC algorithm to agglomerate sequences for tree reconstruction in O(n2) time for n sequences. Simulations show that STC gives better topological accuracy than other tested methods that also build a first starting tree. STC appears as a very good method to start the tree reconstruction. However, all tested methods give similar results if balanced nearest neighbor interchange (BNNI) is applied as a post-processing step. BNNI leads to an improvement in all instances. The program is available at http://www.bi.uni-duesseldorf.de/software/stc/. The results demonstrate that the new approach efficiently reconstructs phylogenies for large data sets. We found that BNNI boosts the topological accuracy of all methods including STC, therefore, one should use BNNI as a post-processing step to get better topological accuracy. 
25.1107	33.9011	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23871964	candidate	A new fast algorithm for solving the minimum spanning tree problem based on DNA molecules computation.	The minimum spanning tree (MST) problem is to find minimum edge connected subsets containing all the vertex of a given undirected graph. It is a vitally important NP-complete problem in graph theory and applied mathematics, having numerous real life applications. Moreover in previous studies, DNA molecular operations usually were used to solve NP-complete head-to-tail path search problems, rarely for NP-hard problems with multi-lateral path solutions result, such as the minimum spanning tree problem. In this paper, we present a new fast DNA algorithm for solving the MST problem using DNA molecular operations. For an undirected graph with n vertex and m edges, we reasonably design flexible length DNA strands representing the vertex and edges, take appropriate steps and get the solutions of the MST problem in proper length range and O(3m+n) time complexity. We extend the application of DNA molecular operations and simultaneity simplify the complexity of the computation. Results of computer simulative experiments show that the proposed method updates some of the best known values with very short time and that the proposed method provides a better performance with solution accuracy over existing algorithms.

An accurate genome sequence of a desired species is now a pre-requisite for genome research. An important step in obtaining a high-quality genome sequence is to correctly assemble short reads into longer sequences accurately representing contiguous genomic regions. Current sequencing technologies continue to offer increases in throughput, and corresponding reductions in cost and time. Unfortunately, the benefit of obtaining a large number of reads is complicated by sequencing errors, with different biases being observed with each platform. Although software are available to assemble reads for each individual system, no procedure has been proposed for high-quality simultaneous assembly based on reads from a mix of different technologies. In this paper, we describe a parallel short-read assembler, called Ray, which has been developed to assemble reads obtained from a combination of sequencing platforms. We compared its performance to other assemblers on simulated and real datasets. We used a combination of Roche/454 and Illumina reads to assemble three different genomes. We showed that mixing sequencing technologies systematically reduces the number of contigs and the number of errors. Because of its open nature, this new tool will hopefully serve as a basis to develop an assembler that can be of universal utilization (availability: http://deNovoAssembler.sf.Net/).

91.7027	13.9207	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19535537	checked	A fast hybrid short read fragment assembly algorithm.	The shorter and vastly more numerous reads produced by second-generation sequencing technologies require new tools that can assemble massive numbers of reads in reasonable time. Existing short-read assembly tools can be classified into two categories: greedy extension-based and graph-based. While the graph-based approaches are generally superior in terms of assembly quality, the computer resources required for building and storing a huge graph are very high. In this article, we present Taipan, an assembly algorithm which can be viewed as a hybrid of these two approaches. Taipan uses greedy extensions for contig construction but at each step realizes enough of the corresponding read graph to make better decisions as to how assembly should continue. We show that this approach can achieve an assembly quality at least as good as the graph-based approaches used in the popular Edena and Velvet assembly tools using a moderate amount of computing resources.

An improved algorithm for the simultaneous alignment of multiple protein and nucleic acid sequences, the Divide-and-Conquer Alignment procedure (DCA), is presented. The basic method described in Tönges,et al. (1996) (Tönges, U., Perrey, S.W., Stoye, J., Dress, A.W.M., 1996. A general method for fast multiple sequence alignment. Gene, 172, GC33-GC41) is generalized to align any number of sequences to work arbitrary (e.g. affine linear) gap penalty functions. Also, the practical efficiency of the method is improved so that families of more than 10 sequences can now be aligned simultaneously within a few seconds or minutes. After a brief description of the general method, we assess the time and memory requirements of our implementation of DCA. We present several examples showing that the program is able to deal with real-world alignment problems.

With the fast advances in nextgen sequencing technology, high-throughput RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful and cost-effective way for transcriptome study. De novo assembly of transcripts provides an important solution to transcriptome analysis for organisms with no reference genome. However, there lacked understanding on how the different variables affected assembly outcomes, and there was no consensus on how to approach an optimal solution by selecting software tool and suitable strategy based on the properties of RNA-Seq data. To reveal the performance of different programs for transcriptome assembly, this work analyzed some important factors, including k-mer values, genome complexity, coverage depth, directional reads, etc. Seven program conditions, four single k-mer assemblers (SK: SOAPdenovo, ABySS, Oases and Trinity) and three multiple k-mer methods (MK: SOAPdenovo-MK, trans-ABySS and Oases-MK) were tested. While small and large k-mer values performed better for reconstructing lowly and highly expressed transcripts, respectively, MK strategy worked well for almost all ranges of expression quintiles. Among SK tools, Trinity performed well across various conditions but took the longest running time. Oases consumed the most memory whereas SOAPdenovo required the shortest runtime but worked poorly to reconstruct full-length CDS. ABySS showed some good balance between resource usage and quality of assemblies. Our work compared the performance of publicly available transcriptome assemblers, and analyzed important factors affecting de novo assembly. Some practical guidelines for transcript reconstruction from short-read RNA-Seq data were proposed. De novo assembly of C. sinensis transcriptome was greatly improved using some optimized methods.

Obtaining high quality multiple alignments is crucial for a range of sequence analysis tasks. A common strategy is to align the sequences several times, varying the program or parameters until the best alignment according to manual inspection by human experts is found. Ideally, this should be assisted by an automatic assessment of the alignment quality. Our web-site http://msa.cgb.ki.se allows users to perform all these steps: Kalign to align sequences, Kalignvu to view and verify the resulting alignments and Mumsa to assess the quality. Due to the computational efficiency of Kalign we can allow users to submit hundreds of sequences to be aligned and still guarantee fast response times. All servers are freely accessible and the underlying software can be freely downloaded for local use. 
116.5442	67.2259	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23872968	checked	On the accuracy of short read mapping.	The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the way we study genomes and gene regulation. In a single experiment, millions of reads are produced. To gain knowledge from these experiments the first thing to be done is finding the genomic origin of the reads, i.e., mapping the reads to a reference genome. In this new situation, conventional alignment tools are obsolete, as they cannot handle this huge amount of data in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, new mapping algorithms have been developed, which are fast at the expense of a small decrease in accuracy. In this chapter we discuss the current problems in short read mapping and show that mapping reads correctly is a nontrivial task. Through simple experiments with both real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that different mappers can give different results depending on the type of data, and that a considerable fraction of uniquely mapped reads is potentially mapped to an incorrect location. Furthermore, we provide simple statistical results on the expected number of random matches in a genome (E-value) and the probability of a random match as a function of read length. Finally, we show that quality scores contain valuable information for mapping and why mapping quality should be evaluated in a probabilistic manner. In the end, we discuss the potential of improving the performance of current methods by considering these quality scores in a probabilistic mapping program.

Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized genome and transcriptome sequencing. RNA-Seq experiments are able to generate huge amounts of transcriptome sequence reads at a fraction of the cost of Sanger sequencing. Reads produced by these technologies are relatively short and error prone. To utilize such reads for transcriptome reconstruction and gene-structure identification, one needs to be able to accurately align the sequence reads over intron boundaries. In this unit, we describe PALMapper, a fast and easy-to-use tool that is designed to accurately compute both unspliced and spliced alignments for millions of RNA-Seq reads. It combines the efficient read mapper GenomeMapper with the spliced aligner QPALMA, which exploits read-quality information and predictions of splice sites to improve the alignment accuracy. The PALMapper package is available as a command-line tool running on Unix or Mac OS X systems or through a Web interface based on Galaxy tools. 
58.3861	36.0623	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22988817	candidate	Mapping single molecule sequencing reads using basic local alignment with successive refinement (BLASR): application and theory.	Recent methods have been developed to perform high-throughput sequencing of DNA by Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS). While Next-Generation sequencing methods may produce reads up to several hundred bases long, SMS sequencing produces reads up to tens of kilobases long. Existing alignment methods are either too inefficient for high-throughput datasets, or not sensitive enough to align SMS reads, which have a higher error rate than Next-Generation sequencing. We describe the method BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement) for mapping Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS) reads that are thousands of bases long, with divergence between the read and genome dominated by insertion and deletion error. The method is benchmarked using both simulated reads and reads from a bacterial sequencing project. We also present a combinatorial model of sequencing error that motivates why our approach is effective. The results indicate that it is possible to map SMS reads with high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, the inferences made on the mapability of SMS reads using our combinatorial model of sequencing error are in agreement with the mapping accuracy demonstrated on simulated reads. 
27.1985	30.2058	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19907642	candidate	BFAST: an alignment tool for large scale genome resequencing.	The new generation of massively parallel DNA sequencers, combined with the challenge of whole human genome resequencing, result in the need for rapid and accurate alignment of billions of short DNA sequence reads to a large reference genome. Speed is obviously of great importance, but equally important is maintaining alignment accuracy of short reads, in the 25-100 base range, in the presence of errors and true biological variation. We introduce a new algorithm specifically optimized for this task, as well as a freely available implementation, BFAST, which can align data produced by any of current sequencing platforms, allows for user-customizable levels of speed and accuracy, supports paired end data, and provides for efficient parallel and multi-threaded computation on a computer cluster. The new method is based on creating flexible, efficient whole genome indexes to rapidly map reads to candidate alignment locations, with arbitrary multiple independent indexes allowed to achieve robustness against read errors and sequence variants. The final local alignment uses a Smith-Waterman method, with gaps to support the detection of small indels. We compare BFAST to a selection of large-scale alignment tools -- BLAT, MAQ, SHRiMP, and SOAP -- in terms of both speed and accuracy, using simulated and real-world datasets. We show BFAST can achieve substantially greater sensitivity of alignment in the context of errors and true variants, especially insertions and deletions, and minimize false mappings, while maintaining adequate speed compared to other current methods. We show BFAST can align the amount of data needed to fully resequence a human genome, one billion reads, with high sensitivity and accuracy, on a modest computer cluster in less than 24 hours. BFAST is available at (http://bfast.sourceforge.net). 
58.2360	16.8775	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22537045	checked	An improved approach for accurate and efficient calling of structural variations with low-coverage sequence data.	Recent advances in sequencing technologies make it possible to comprehensively study structural variations (SVs) using sequence data of large-scale populations. Currently, more efforts have been taken to develop methods that call SVs with exact breakpoints. Among these approaches, split-read mapping methods can be applied on low-coverage sequence data. With increasing amount of data generated, more efficient split-read mapping methods are still needed. Also, since sequence errors can not be avoided for the current sequencing technologies, more accurate split-read mapping methods are still needed to better handle sequence errors. In this paper, we present a split-read mapping method implemented in the program SVseq2 which improves our previous work SVseq1. Similar to SVseq1, SVseq2 calls deletions (and insertions) with exact breakpoints. SVseq2 achieves more accurate calling through split-read mapping within focal regions. SVseq2 also has a much desired feature: there is no need to specify the maximum deletion size, while some existing split-read mapping methods need more memory and longer running time when larger maximum deletion size is chosen. SVseq2 is also much faster because it only needs to examine a small number of ways of splitting the reads. Moreover, SVseq2 supports insertion calling from low-coverage sequence data, while SVseq1 only supports deletion finding. The program SVseq2 can be downloaded at http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~jiz08001/. SVseq2 enables accurate and efficient SV calling through split-read mapping within focal regions using paired-end reads. For many simulated data and real sequence data, SVseq2 outperforms some other existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency, especially when sequence coverage is low.

Massively parallel sequencing readouts of epigenomic assays are enabling integrative genome-wide analyses of genomic and epigenomic variation. Pash 3.0 performs sequence comparison and read mapping and can be employed as a module within diverse configurable analysis pipelines, including ChIP-Seq and methylome mapping by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Pash 3.0 generally matches the accuracy and speed of niche programs for fast mapping of short reads, and exceeds their performance on longer reads generated by a new generation of massively parallel sequencing technologies. By exploiting longer read lengths, Pash 3.0 maps reads onto the large fraction of genomic DNA that contains repetitive elements and polymorphic sites, including indel polymorphisms. We demonstrate the versatility of Pash 3.0 by analyzing the interaction between CpG methylation, CpG SNPs, and imprinting based on publicly available whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing data. Pash 3.0 makes use of gapped k-mer alignment, a non-seed based comparison method, which is implemented using multi-positional hash tables. This allows Pash 3.0 to run on diverse hardware platforms, including individual computers with standard RAM capacity, multi-core hardware architectures and large clusters. 
5.1649	26.8401	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19405957	candidate	Efficient context-dependent model building based on clustering posterior distributions for non-coding sequences.	Many recent studies that relax the assumption of independent evolution of sites have done so at the expense of a drastic increase in the number of substitution parameters. While additional parameters cannot be avoided to model context-dependent evolution, a large increase in model dimensionality is only justified when accompanied with careful model-building strategies that guard against overfitting. An increased dimensionality leads to increases in numerical computations of the models, increased convergence times in Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and even more tedious Bayes Factor calculations. We have developed two model-search algorithms which reduce the number of Bayes Factor calculations by clustering posterior densities to decide on the equality of substitution behavior in different contexts. The selected model's fit is evaluated using a Bayes Factor, which we calculate via model-switch thermodynamic integration. To reduce computation time and to increase the precision of this integration, we propose to split the calculations over different computers and to appropriately calibrate the individual runs. Using the proposed strategies, we find, in a dataset of primate Ancestral Repeats, that careful modeling of context-dependent evolution may increase model fit considerably and that the combination of a context-dependent model with the assumption of varying rates across sites offers even larger improvements in terms of model fit. Using a smaller nuclear SSU rRNA dataset, we show that context-dependence may only become detectable upon applying model-building strategies. While context-dependent evolutionary models can increase the model fit over traditional independent evolutionary models, such complex models will often contain too many parameters. Justification for the added parameters is thus required so that only those parameters that model evolutionary processes previously unaccounted for are added to the evolutionary model. To obtain an optimal balance between the number of parameters in a context-dependent model and the performance in terms of model fit, we have designed two parameter-reduction strategies and we have shown that model fit can be greatly improved by reducing the number of parameters in a context-dependent evolutionary model. 
34.0872	9.4729	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24894600	candidate	PVT: an efficient computational procedure to speed up next-generation sequence analysis.	High-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques are advancing genomics and molecular biology research. This technology generates substantially large data which puts up a major challenge to the scientists for an efficient, cost and time effective solution to analyse such data. Further, for the different types of NGS data, there are certain common challenging steps involved in analysing those data. Spliced alignment is one such fundamental step in NGS data analysis which is extremely computational intensive as well as time consuming. There exists serious problem even with the most widely used spliced alignment tools. TopHat is one such widely used spliced alignment tools which although supports multithreading, does not efficiently utilize computational resources in terms of CPU utilization and memory. Here we have introduced PVT (Pipelined Version of TopHat) where we take up a modular approach by breaking TopHat's serial execution into a pipeline of multiple stages, thereby increasing the degree of parallelization and computational resource utilization. Thus we address the discrepancies in TopHat so as to analyze large NGS data efficiently. We analysed the SRA dataset (SRX026839 and SRX026838) consisting of single end reads and SRA data SRR1027730 consisting of paired-end reads. We used TopHat v2.0.8 to analyse these datasets and noted the CPU usage, memory footprint and execution time during spliced alignment. With this basic information, we designed PVT, a pipelined version of TopHat that removes the redundant computational steps during 'spliced alignment' and breaks the job into a pipeline of multiple stages (each comprising of different step(s)) to improve its resource utilization, thus reducing the execution time. PVT provides an improvement over TopHat for spliced alignment of NGS data analysis. PVT thus resulted in the reduction of the execution time to ~23% for the single end read dataset. Further, PVT designed for paired end reads showed an improved performance of ~41% over TopHat (for the chosen data) with respect to execution time. Moreover we propose PVT-Cloud which implements PVT pipeline in cloud computing system.

Recent sequencing and computing advances have enabled phylogenetic analyses to expand to both entire genomes and large clades, thus requiring more efficient and accurate methods designed specifically for the phylogenomic context. Here, we present SPIMAP, an efficient Bayesian method for reconstructing gene trees in the presence of a known species tree. We observe many improvements in reconstruction accuracy, achieved by modeling multiple aspects of evolution, including gene duplication and loss (DL) rates, speciation times, and correlated substitution rate variation across both species and loci. We have implemented and applied this method on two clades of fully sequenced species, 12 Drosophila and 16 fungal genomes as well as simulated phylogenies and find dramatic improvements in reconstruction accuracy as compared with the most popular existing methods, including those that take the species tree into account. We find that reconstruction inaccuracies of traditional phylogenetic methods overestimate the number of DL events by as much as 2-3-fold, whereas our method achieves significantly higher accuracy. We feel that the results and methods presented here will have many important implications for future investigations of gene evolution. 
8.9689	3.9098	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22010755	candidate	Brute force meets Bruno force in parameter optimisation: introduction of novel constraints for parameter accuracy improvement by symbolic computation.	Recent remarkable advances in computer performance have enabled us to estimate parameter values by the huge power of numerical computation, the so-called 'Brute force', resulting in the high-speed simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameter values. However, these advancements have not been fully utilised to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation. Here the authors review a novel method for parameter estimation using symbolic computation power, 'Bruno force', named after Bruno Buchberger, who found the Gröbner base. In the method, the objective functions combining the symbolic computation techniques are formulated. First, the authors utilise a symbolic computation technique, differential elimination, which symbolically reduces an equivalent system of differential equations to a system in a given model. Second, since its equivalent system is frequently composed of large equations, the system is further simplified by another symbolic computation. The performance of the authors' method for parameter accuracy improvement is illustrated by two representative models in biology, a simple cascade model and a negative feedback model in comparison with the previous numerical methods. Finally, the limits and extensions of the authors' method are discussed, in terms of the possible power of 'Bruno force' for the development of a new horizon in parameter estimation. 
11.1834	8.5482	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093431	candidate	Performance of relaxed-clock methods in estimating evolutionary divergence times and their credibility intervals.	The rapid expansion of sequence data and the development of statistical approaches that embrace varying evolutionary rates among lineages have encouraged many more investigators to use DNA and protein data to time species divergences. Here, we report results from a systematic evaluation, by means of computer simulation, of the performance of two frequently used relaxed-clock methods for estimating these times and their credibility intervals (CrIs). These relaxed-clock methods allow rates to vary in a phylogeny randomly over lineages (e.g., BEAST software) and in autocorrelated fashion (e.g., MultiDivTime software). We applied these methods for analyzing sequence data sets simulated using naturally derived parameters (evolutionary rates, sequence lengths, and base substitution patterns) and assuming that clock calibrations are known without error. We find that the estimated times are, on average, close to the true times as long as the assumed model of lineage rate changes matches the actual model. The 95% CrIs also contain the true time for &gt;or=95% of the simulated data sets. However, the use of incorrect lineage rate model reduces this frequency to 83%, indicating that the relaxed-clock methods are not robust to the violation of underlying lineage rate model. Because these rate models are rarely known a priori and are difficult to detect empirically, we suggest building composite CrIs using CrIs produced from MultiDivTime and BEAST analysis. These composite CrIs are found to contain the true time for &gt;or=97% data sets. Our analyses also verify the usefulness of the common practice of interpreting the congruence of times inferred from different methods as a reflection of the accuracy of time estimates. Overall, our results show that simple strategies can be used to enhance our ability to estimate times and their CrIs when using the relaxed-clock methods.

Quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction methods, such as Quartet Puzzling, were introduced in the hope that they might be competitive with maximum likelihood methods, without being as computationally intensive. However, despite the numerous quartet-based methods that have been developed, their performance in simulation has been disappointing. In particular, Ranwez and Gascuel, the developers of one of the best quartet methods, conjecture that quartet-based methods have inherent limitations that make them unable to produce trees as accurate as neighbor joining or maximum parsimony. In this paper, we present Short Quartet Puzzling, a new quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction algorithm, and we demonstrate the improved topological accuracy of the new method over maximum parsimony and neighbor joining, disproving the conjecture of Ranwez and Gascuel. We also show a dramatic improvement over Quartet Puzzling. Thus, while our new method is not compared to any ML method (as it is not expected to be as accurate as the best of these), this study shows that quartet methods are not as limited in performance as was previously conjectured, and opens the possibility to further improvements through new algorithmic designs.

4.3292	15.1870	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23523719	candidate	Fast and accurate reference-free alignment of subtomograms.	In cryoelectron tomography alignment and averaging of subtomograms, each dnepicting the same macromolecule, improves the resolution compared to the individual subtomogram. Major challenges of subtomogram alignment are noise enhancement due to overfitting, the bias of an initial reference in the iterative alignment process, and the computational cost of processing increasingly large amounts of data. Here, we propose an efficient and accurate alignment algorithm via a generalized convolution theorem, which allows computation of a constrained correlation function using spherical harmonics. This formulation increases computational speed of rotational matching dramatically compared to rotation search in Cartesian space without sacrificing accuracy in contrast to other spherical harmonic based approaches. Using this sampling method, a reference-free alignment procedure is proposed to tackle reference bias and overfitting, which also includes contrast transfer function correction by Wiener filtering. Application of the method to simulated data allowed us to obtain resolutions near the ground truth. For two experimental datasets, ribosomes from yeast lysate and purified 20S proteasomes, we achieved reconstructions of approximately 20Å and 16Å, respectively. The software is ready-to-use and made public to the community. 
38.5384	48.2033	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26031838	candidate	Current Methods for Automated Filtering of Multiple Sequence Alignments Frequently Worsen Single-Gene Phylogenetic Inference.	Phylogenetic inference is generally performed on the basis of multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Because errors in an alignment can lead to errors in tree estimation, there is a strong interest in identifying and removing unreliable parts of the alignment. In recent years several automated filtering approaches have been proposed, but despite their popularity, a systematic and comprehensive comparison of different alignment filtering methods on real data has been lacking. Here, we extend and apply recently introduced phylogenetic tests of alignment accuracy on a large number of gene families and contrast the performance of unfiltered versus filtered alignments in the context of single-gene phylogeny reconstruction. Based on multiple genome-wide empirical and simulated data sets, we show that the trees obtained from filtered MSAs are on average worse than those obtained from unfiltered MSAs. Furthermore, alignment filtering often leads to an increase in the proportion of well-supported branches that are actually wrong. We confirm that our findings hold for a wide range of parameters and methods. Although our results suggest that light filtering (up to 20% of alignment positions) has little impact on tree accuracy and may save some computation time, contrary to widespread practice, we do not generally recommend the use of current alignment filtering methods for phylogenetic inference. By providing a way to rigorously and systematically measure the impact of filtering on alignments, the methodology set forth here will guide the development of better filtering algorithms. 
17.0372	14.0933	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849525	candidate	Genome-wide nucleotide-level mammalian ancestor reconstruction.	Recently attention has been turned to the problem of reconstructing complete ancestral sequences from large multiple alignments. Successful generation of these genome-wide reconstructions will facilitate a greater knowledge of the events that have driven evolution. We present a new evolutionary alignment modeler, called &quot;Ortheus,&quot; for inferring the evolutionary history of a multiple alignment, in terms of both substitutions and, importantly, insertions and deletions. Based on a multiple sequence probabilistic transducer model of the type proposed by Holmes, Ortheus uses efficient stochastic graph-based dynamic programming methods. Unlike other methods, Ortheus does not rely on a single fixed alignment from which to work. Ortheus is also more scaleable than previous methods while being fast, stable, and open source. Large-scale simulations show that Ortheus performs close to optimally on a deep mammalian phylogeny. Simulations also indicate that significant proportions of errors due to insertions and deletions can be avoided by not assuming a fixed alignment. We additionally use a challenging hold-out cross-validation procedure to test the method; using the reconstructions to predict extant sequence bases, we demonstrate significant improvements over using closest extant neighbor sequences. Accompanying this paper, a new, public, and genome-wide set of Ortheus ancestor alignments provide an intriguing new resource for evolutionary studies in mammals. As a first piece of analysis, we attempt to recover &quot;fossilized&quot; ancestral pseudogenes. We confidently find 31 cases in which the ancestral sequence had a more complete sequence than any of the extant sequences.

Accurate reconstruction of phylogenetic trees often involves solving hard optimisation problems, particularly the Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) problems. Various heuristics yield good results for these problems within reasonable time only on small datasets. This is a major impediment for large-scale phylogeny reconstruction. Roshan et al. introduced Rec-I-DCM3, an efficient and accurate meta-method for solving the MP problem on large datasets of up to 14,000 taxa. We improve the performance of Rec-I-DCM3 via parallelisation. The experiments demonstrate that our parallel method, PRec-I-DCM3, achieves significant improvements, both in speed and accuracy, over its sequential counterpart.

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a vital problem in biology. Optimal alignment of multiple sequences becomes impractical even for a modest number of sequences since the general version of the problem is NP-hard. Because of the high time complexity of traditional MSA algorithms, even today's fast computers are not able to solve the problem for large number of sequences. In this paper we present a randomized algorithm to calculate distance matrices, which is a major step in many multiple sequence alignment algorithms. The basic idea employed is sampling (along the lines of). We also illustrate how to parallelize this algorithm. In Section we introduce the problem of multiple sequence alignments. In Section we provide a discussion on various methods that have been employed in the literature for Multiple Sequence Alignment. In this section we also introduce our new sampling approach. We extend our randomized algorithm to the case of non-uniform length sequences as well. We show that our algorithms are amenable to parallelism in Section. In Section we back up our claim of speedup and accuracy with empirical data and examples. In Section we provide some concluding remarks.

Phylogeny reconstruction is the process of inferring evolutionary relationships from molecular sequences, and methods that are expected to accurately reconstruct trees from sequences of reasonable length are highly desirable. To formalize this concept, the property of fast-convergence has been introduced to describe phylogeny reconstruction methods that, with high probability, recover the true tree from sequences that grow polynomially in the number of taxa n. While provably fast-converging methods have been developed, the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of Saitou and Nei remains one of the most popular methods used in practice. This algorithm is known to converge for sequences that are exponential in n, but no lower bound for its convergence rate has been established. To address this theoretical question, we analyze the performance of the NJ algorithm on a type of phylogeny known as a 'caterpillar tree'. We find that, for sequences of polynomial length in the number of taxa n, the variability of the NJ criterion is sufficiently high that the algorithm is likely to fail even in the first step of the phylogeny reconstruction process, regardless of the degree of polynomial considered. This result demonstrates that, for general n-taxa trees, the exponential bound cannot be improved.

The very large memory requirements for the construction of assembly graphs for de novo genome assembly limit current algorithms to super-computing environments. In this paper, we demonstrate that constructing a sparse assembly graph which stores only a small fraction of the observed k-mers as nodes and the links between these nodes allows the de novo assembly of even moderately-sized genomes (~500 M) on a typical laptop computer. We implement this sparse graph concept in a proof-of-principle software package, SparseAssembler, utilizing a new sparse k-mer graph structure evolved from the de Bruijn graph. We test our SparseAssembler with both simulated and real data, achieving ~90% memory savings and retaining high assembly accuracy, without sacrificing speed in comparison to existing de novo assemblers. 
105.4156	1.3404	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18218120	candidate	Reconstructing phylogenies from noisy quartets in polynomial time with a high success probability.	In recent years, quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction methods have received considerable attentions in the computational biology community. Traditionally, the accuracy of a phylogeny reconstruction method is measured by simulations on synthetic datasets with known &quot;true&quot; phylogenies, while little theoretical analysis has been done. In this paper, we present a new model-based approach to measuring the accuracy of a quartet-based phylogeny reconstruction method. Under this model, we propose three efficient algorithms to reconstruct the &quot;true&quot; phylogeny with a high success probability. The first algorithm can reconstruct the &quot;true&quot; phylogeny from the input quartet topology set without quartet errors in O(n2) time by querying at most (n - 4) log(n - 1) quartet topologies, where n is the number of the taxa. When the input quartet topology set contains errors, the second algorithm can reconstruct the &quot;true&quot; phylogeny with a probability approximately 1 - p in O(n4 log n) time, where p is the probability for a quartet topology being an error. This probability is improved by the third algorithm to approximately [equation; see text], where [equation, see text], with running time of O(n5), which is at least 0.984 when p &lt; 0.05. The three proposed algorithms are mathematically guaranteed to reconstruct the &quot;true&quot; phylogeny with a high success probability. The experimental results showed that the third algorithm produced phylogenies with a higher probability than its aforementioned theoretical lower bound and outperformed some existing phylogeny reconstruction methods in both speed and accuracy.

36.3420	42.0875	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20550700	checked	Detecting lateral gene transfers by statistical reconciliation of phylogenetic forests.	To understand the evolutionary role of Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT), accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes and infer their timing of acquisition. Phylogenetic methods are particularly promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition, the application of these methods to real data raises the problem of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict. We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF) between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible as it can use any definition of &quot;agreement&quot; among trees. We evaluate the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT) for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring the tree of life. The ability of Prunier to take into account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily run on large datasets.Prunier is implemented in C++, using the Bio++ library and the phylogeny program Treefinder. It is available at: http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/prunier.

In this paper, we introduce a fast and accurate side-chain modeling method, named OPUS-Rota. In a benchmark comparison with the methods SCWRL, NCN, LGA, SPRUCE, Rosetta, and SCAP, OPUS-Rota is shown to be much faster than all the methods except SCWRL, which is comparably fast. In terms of overall chi (1) and chi (1+2) accuracies, however, OPUS-Rota is 5.4 and 8.8 percentage points better, respectively, than SCWRL. Compared with NCN, which has the best accuracy in the literature, OPUS-Rota is 1.6 percentage points better for overall chi (1+2) but 0.3 percentage points weaker for overall chi (1). Hence, our algorithm is much more accurate than SCWRL with similar execution speed, and it has accuracy comparable to or better than the most accurate methods in the literature, but with a runtime that is one or two orders of magnitude shorter. In addition, OPUS-Rota consistently outperforms SCWRL on the Wallner and Elofsson homology-modeling benchmark set when the sequence identity is greater than 40%. We hope that OPUS-Rota will contribute to high-accuracy structure refinement, and the computer program is freely available for academic users. 
48.8750	27.6796	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25371430	candidate	IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies.	Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2% and 87.1% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7% and 47.1% of the DNA alignments and 42.2% and 100% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3-97.1%. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree. 
17.5661	22.7795	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16234323	candidate	Improving the efficiency of SPR moves in phylogenetic tree search methods based on maximum likelihood.	Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have become very popular for constructing phylogenetic trees from sequence data. However, despite noticeable recent progress, with large and difficult datasets (e.g. multiple genes with conflicting signals) current ML programs still require huge computing time and can become trapped in bad local optima of the likelihood function. When this occurs, the resulting trees may still show some of the defects (e.g. long branch attraction) of starting trees obtained using fast distance or parsimony programs. Subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) topological rearrangements are usually sufficient to intensively search the tree space. Here, we propose two new methods to make SPR moves more efficient. The first method uses a fast distance-based approach to detect the least promising candidate SPR moves, which are then simply discarded. The second method locally estimates the change in likelihood for any remaining potential SPRs, as opposed to globally evaluating the entire tree for each possible move. These two methods are implemented in a new algorithm with a sophisticated filtering strategy, which efficiently selects potential SPRs and concentrates most of the likelihood computation on the promising moves. Experiments with real datasets comprising 35-250 taxa show that, while indeed greatly reducing the amount of computation, our approach provides likelihood values at least as good as those of the best-known ML methods so far and is very robust to poor starting trees. Furthermore, combining our new SPR algorithm with local moves such as PHYML's nearest neighbor interchanges, the time needed to find good solutions can sometimes be reduced even more.

Particle tracking is of key importance for quantitative analysis of intracellular dynamic processes from time-lapse microscopy image data. Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers. 
269.3810	724.6667	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758764	training	Benchmarking short sequence mapping tools.	The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various aspects and provide an objective comparison. We applied our benchmarking tests on 9 well known mapping tools, namely, Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, MAQ, RMAP, GSNAP, Novoalign, and mrsFAST (mrFAST) using synthetic data and real RNA-Seq data. MAQ and RMAP are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining tools are based on indexing the reference genome. The benchmarking tests reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. The results show that no single tool outperforms all others in all metrics. However, Bowtie maintained the best throughput for most of the tests while BWA performed better for longer read lengths. The benchmarking tests are not restricted to the mentioned tools and can be further applied to others. The mapping process is still a hard problem that is affected by many factors. In this work, we provided a benchmarking suite that reveals and evaluates the different factors affecting the mapping process. Still, there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in all the tests. Therefore, the end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides the best results.

Several new de novo assembly tools have been developed recently to assemble short sequencing reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms. However, the performance of these tools under various conditions has not been fully investigated, and sufficient information is not currently available for informed decisions to be made regarding the tool that would be most likely to produce the best performance under a specific set of conditions. We studied and compared the performance of commonly used de novo assembly tools specifically designed for next-generation sequencing data, including SSAKE, VCAKE, Euler-sr, Edena, Velvet, ABySS and SOAPdenovo. Tools were compared using several performance criteria, including N50 length, sequence coverage and assembly accuracy. Various properties of read data, including single-end/paired-end, sequence GC content, depth of coverage and base calling error rates, were investigated for their effects on the performance of different assembly tools. We also compared the computation time and memory usage of these seven tools. Based on the results of our comparison, the relative performance of individual tools are summarized and tentative guidelines for optimal selection of different assembly tools, under different conditions, are provided. 
4.0738	39.9983	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26448206	checked	Consequences of Common Topological Rearrangements for Partition Trees in Phylogenomic Inference.	In phylogenomic analysis the collection of trees with identical score (maximum likelihood or parsimony score) may hamper tree search algorithms. Such collections are coined phylogenetic terraces. For sparse supermatrices with a lot of missing data, the number of terraces and the number of trees on the terraces can be very large. If terraces are not taken into account, a lot of computation time might be unnecessarily spent to evaluate many trees that in fact have identical score. To save computation time during the tree search, it is worthwhile to quickly identify such cases. The score of a species tree is the sum of scores for all the so-called induced partition trees. Therefore, if the topological rearrangement applied to a species tree does not change the induced partition trees, the score of these partition trees is unchanged. Here, we provide the conditions under which the three most widely used topological rearrangements (nearest neighbor interchange, subtree pruning and regrafting, and tree bisection and reconnection) change the topologies of induced partition trees. During the tree search, these conditions allow us to quickly identify whether we can save computation time on the evaluation of newly encountered trees. We also introduce the concept of partial terraces and demonstrate that they occur more frequently than the original &quot;full&quot; terrace. Hence, partial terrace is the more important factor of timesaving compared to full terrace. Therefore, taking into account the above conditions and the partial terrace concept will help to speed up the tree search in phylogenomic inference.

The maximum expected accuracy optimization criterion for multiple sequence alignment uses pairwise posterior probabilities of residues to align sequences. The partition function methodology is one way of estimating these probabilities. Here, we combine these two ideas for the first time to construct maximal expected accuracy sequence alignments. We bridge the two techniques within the program Probalign. Our results indicate that Probalign alignments are generally more accurate than other leading multiple sequence alignment methods (i.e. Probcons, MAFFT and MUSCLE) on the BAliBASE 3.0 protein alignment benchmark. Similarly, Probalign also outperforms these methods on the HOMSTRAD and OXBENCH benchmarks. Probalign ranks statistically highest (P-value &lt; 0.005) on all three benchmarks. Deeper scrutiny of the technique indicates that the improvements are largest on datasets containing N/C-terminal extensions and on datasets containing long and heterogeneous length proteins. These points are demonstrated on both real and simulated data. Finally, our method also produces accurate alignments on long and heterogeneous length datasets containing protein repeats. Here, alignment accuracy scores are at least 10% and 15% higher than the other three methods when standard deviation of length is &gt;300 and 400, respectively.

Multiple sequence alignment is one of the most recurrent assignments in Bioinformatics. This method allows organizing a set of molecular sequences in order to expose their similarities and their differences. Although exact methods exist for solving this problem, their use is limited by the computing demands which are necessary for exploring such a large and complex search space. Genetic Algorithms are adaptive search methods which perform well in large and complex spaces. Parallel Genetic Algorithms, not only increase the speed up of the search, but also improve its efficiency, presenting results that are better than those provided by the sum of several sequential Genetic Algorithms. Although these methods are often used to optimize a single objective, they can also be used in multidimensional domains, finding all possible tradeoffs among multiple conflicting objectives. Parallel AlineaGA is an Evolutionary Algorithm which uses a Parallel Genetic Algorithm for performing multiple sequence alignment. We now present the Parallel Niche Pareto AlineaGA, a multiobjective version of Parallel AlineaGA. We compare the performance of both versions using eight BAliBASE datasets. We also measure up the quality of the obtained solutions with the ones achieved by T-Coffee and ClustalW2, allowing us to observe that our algorithm reaches for better solutions in the majority of the datasets.

MethylCoder outputs data in text and binary formats in addition to the final alignment in SAM format, so that common high-throughput sequencing tools can be used on the resulting output.

Deep sequencing has become the method of choice for determining the small RNA content of a cell. Mapping the sequenced reads onto their reference genome serves as the basis for all further analyses, namely for identification and quantification. A method frequently used is Mega BLAST followed by several filtering steps, even though it is slow and inefficient for this task. Also, none of the currently available short read aligners has established itself for the particular task of small RNA mapping. We present MicroRazerS, a tool optimized for mapping small RNAs onto a reference genome. It is an order of magnitude faster than Mega BLAST and comparable in speed with other short read mapping tools. In addition, it is more sensitive and easy to handle and adjust.

In this paper, we present a simple and efficient algorithm for multiple genome sequence alignment. Sequences of Maximal Unique Matches (MUMs) are first transformed into a multi-bipartite diagram. The diagram is then converted into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Therefore, finding the alignment is reduced to finding the longest path in the DAG, which is solvable in linear time. The experiments show that the algorithm can correctly find the alignment, and runs faster than MGA and EMAGEN. In addition, our algorithm can handle the alignments with overlapping MUMs and has both weighted and unweighted options. It provides the flexibility for the alignments depending on different needs. 
303.1893	649.8495	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521762	training	Assessment of de novo assemblers for draft genomes: a case study with fungal genomes.	Recently, large bio-projects dealing with the release of different genomes have transpired. Most of these projects use next-generation sequencing platforms. As a consequence, many de novo assembly tools have evolved to assemble the reads generated by these platforms. Each tool has its own inherent advantages and disadvantages, which make the selection of an appropriate tool a challenging task. We have evaluated the performance of frequently used de novo assemblers namely ABySS, IDBA-UD, Minia, SOAP, SPAdes, Sparse, and Velvet. These assemblers are assessed based on their output quality during the assembly process conducted over fungal data. We compared the performance of these assemblers by considering both computational as well as quality metrics. By analyzing these performance metrics, the assemblers are ranked and a procedure for choosing the candidate assembler is illustrated. In this study, we propose an assessment method for the selection of de novo assemblers by considering their computational as well as quality metrics at the draft genome level. We divide the quality metrics into three groups: g1 measures the goodness of the assemblies, g2 measures the problems of the assemblies, and g3 measures the conservation elements in the assemblies. Our results demonstrate that the assemblers ABySS and IDBA-UD exhibit a good performance for the studied data from fungal genomes in terms of running time, memory, and quality. The results suggest that whole genome shotgun sequencing projects should make use of different assemblers by considering their merits. 
219.8226	675.3426	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22152123	training	Fast and accurate methods for phylogenomic analyses.	Species phylogenies are not estimated directly, but rather through phylogenetic analyses of different gene datasets. However, true gene trees can differ from the true species tree (and hence from one another) due to biological processes such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and gene duplication and loss, so that no single gene tree is a reliable estimate of the species tree. Several methods have been developed to estimate species trees from estimated gene trees, differing according to the specific algorithmic technique used and the biological model used to explain differences between species and gene trees. Relatively little is known about the relative performance of these methods. We report on a study evaluating several different methods for estimating species trees from sequence datasets, simulating sequence evolution under a complex model including indels (insertions and deletions), substitutions, and incomplete lineage sorting. The most important finding of our study is that some fast and simple methods are nearly as accurate as the most accurate methods, which employ sophisticated statistical methods and are computationally quite intensive. We also observe that methods that explicitly consider errors in the estimated gene trees produce more accurate trees than methods that assume the estimated gene trees are correct. Our study shows that highly accurate estimations of species trees are achievable, even when gene trees differ from each other and from the species tree, and that these estimations can be obtained using fairly simple and computationally tractable methods. 
3.1941	28.0151	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21385046	candidate	Generalized buneman pruning for inferring the most parsimonious multi-state phylogeny.	Accurate reconstruction of phylogenies remains a key challenge in evolutionary biology. Most biologically plausible formulations of the problem are formally NP-hard, with no known efficient solution. The standard in practice are fast heuristic methods that are empirically known to work very well in general, but can yield results arbitrarily far from optimal. Practical exact methods, which yield exponential worst-case running times but generally much better times in practice, provide an important alternative. We report progress in this direction by introducing a provably optimal method for the weighted multi-state maximum parsimony phylogeny problem. The method is based on generalizing the notion of the Buneman graph, a construction key to efficient exact methods for binary sequences, so as to apply to sequences with arbitrary finite numbers of states with arbitrary state transition weights. We implement an integer linear programming (ILP) method for the multi-state problem using this generalized Buneman graph and demonstrate that the resulting method is able to solve data sets that are intractable by prior exact methods in run times comparable with popular heuristics. We further show on a collection of less difficult problem instances that the ILP method leads to large reductions in average-case run times relative to leading heuristics on moderately hard problems. Our work provides the first method for provably optimal maximum parsimony phylogeny inference that is practical for multi-state data sets of more than a few characters. 
26.0334	8.5969	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17883866	candidate	Accuracy of structure-based sequence alignment of automatic methods.	Accurate sequence alignments are essential for homology searches and for building three-dimensional structural models of proteins. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, structure alignments have been used to guide sequence alignments and are commonly used as the gold standard for sequence alignment evaluation. Nonetheless, as far as we know, there is no report of a systematic evaluation of pairwise structure alignment programs in terms of the sequence alignment accuracy. In this study, we evaluate CE, DaliLite, FAST, LOCK2, MATRAS, SHEBA and VAST in terms of the accuracy of the sequence alignments they produce, using sequence alignments from NCBI's human-curated Conserved Domain Database (CDD) as the standard of truth. We find that 4 to 9% of the residues on average are either not aligned or aligned with more than 8 residues of shift error and that an additional 6 to 14% of residues on average are misaligned by 1-8 residues, depending on the program and the data set used. The fraction of correctly aligned residues generally decreases as the sequence similarity decreases or as the RMSD between the C alpha positions of the two structures increases. It varies significantly across CDD superfamilies whether shift error is allowed or not. Also, alignments with different shift errors occur between proteins within the same CDD superfamily, leading to inconsistent alignments between superfamily members. In general, residue pairs that are more than 3.0 A apart in the reference alignment are heavily (&gt;or= 25% on average) misaligned in the test alignments. In addition, each method shows a different pattern of relative weaknesses for different SCOP classes. CE gives relatively poor results for beta-sheet-containing structures (all-beta, alpha/beta, and alpha+beta classes), DaliLite for &quot;others&quot; class where all but the major four classes are combined, and LOCK2 and VAST for all-beta and &quot;others&quot; classes. When the sequence similarity is low, structure-based methods produce better sequence alignments than by using sequence similarities alone. However, current structure-based methods still mis-align 11-19% of the conserved core residues when compared to the human-curated CDD alignments. The alignment quality of each program depends on the protein structural type and similarity, with DaliLite showing the most agreement with CDD on average. 
27.5874	25.3410	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25015987	candidate	MAGNA: Maximizing Accuracy in Global Network Alignment.	Biological network alignment aims to identify similar regions between networks of different species. Existing methods compute node similarities to rapidly identify from possible alignments the high-scoring alignments with respect to the overall node similarity. But, the accuracy of the alignments is then evaluated with some other measure that is different than the node similarity used to construct the alignments. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges. Thus, the existing methods align similar nodes between networks hoping to conserve many edges (after the alignment is constructed!). Instead, we introduce MAGNA to directly 'optimize' edge conservation while the alignment is constructed, without decreasing the quality of node mapping. MAGNA uses a genetic algorithm and our novel function for 'crossover' of two 'parent' alignments into a superior 'child' alignment to simulate a 'population' of alignments that 'evolves' over time; the 'fittest' alignments survive and proceed to the next 'generation', until the alignment accuracy cannot be optimized further. While we optimize our new and superior measure of the amount of conserved edges, MAGNA can optimize any alignment accuracy measure, including a combined measure of both node and edge conservation. In systematic evaluations against state-of-the-art methods (IsoRank, MI-GRAAL and GHOST), on both synthetic networks and real-world biological data, MAGNA outperforms all of the existing methods, in terms of both node and edge conservation as well as both topological and biological alignment accuracy.

Next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have advanced progressively in sequence-based genomic research and novel biological applications with the promise of sequencing DNA at unprecedented speed. These new non-Sanger-based technologies feature several advantages when compared with traditional sequencing methods in terms of higher sequencing speed, lower per run cost and higher accuracy. However, reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as 454/Roche, ABI/SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa, are usually short, thereby restricting the applications of NGS platforms in genome assembly and annotation. We presented an overview of the challenges that these novel technologies meet and particularly illustrated various bioinformatics attempts on mapping and assembly for problem solving. We then compared the performance of several programs in these two fields, and further provided advices on selecting suitable tools for specific biological applications. 
121.4255	12.0174	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22369143	checked	A mixture framework for inferring ancestral gene orders.	Inferring gene orders of ancestral genomes has the potential to provide detailed information about the recent evolution of species descended from them. Current popular tools to infer ancestral genome data (such as GRAPPA and MGR) are all parsimony-based direct optimization methods with the aim to minimize the number of evolutionary events. Recently a new method based on the approach of maximum likelihood is proposed. The current implementation of these direct optimization methods are all based on solving the median problems and achieve more accurate results than the maximum likelihood method. However, both GRAPPA and MGR are extremely time consuming under high rearrangement rates. The maximum likelihood method, on the contrary, runs much faster with less accurate results. We propose a mixture method to optimize the inference of ancestral gene orders. This method first uses the maximum likelihood approach to identify gene adjacencies that are likely to be present in the ancestral genomes, which are then fixed in the branch-and-bound search of median calculations. This hybrid approach not only greatly speeds up the direct optimization methods, but also retains high accuracy even when the genomes are evolutionary very distant. Our mixture method produces more accurate ancestral genomes compared with the maximum likelihood method while the computation time is far less than that of the parsimony-based direct optimization methods. It can effectively deal with genome data of relatively high rearrangement rates which is hard for the direct optimization methods to solve in a reasonable amount of time, thus extends the range of data that can be analyzed by the existing methods.

Computational models in systems biology are usually characterized by a lack of reliable parameter values. This is especially true for kinetic metabolic models. Experimental data can be used to estimate these missing parameters. Different optimization techniques have been explored to solve this challenging task but none has proved to be superior to the other. In this paper we review the problem of parameter estimation in kinetic models. We focus on the suitability of four commonly used optimization techniques of parameter estimation in biochemical pathways and make a comparison between those methods. The suitability of each technique is evaluated based on the ability of converging to a solution within a reasonable amount of time. As most local optimization methods fail to arrive at a satisfactory solution we only considered the global optimization techniques. A case study of the upper part of Glycolysis consisting 15 parameters is taken as the benchmark model for evaluating these methods. 
56.4492	9.5162	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21670797	candidate	A comparison of four pair-wise sequence alignment methods.	Protein sequence alignment has become an essential task in modern molecular biology research. A number of alignment techniques have been documented in literature and their corresponding tools are made available as freeware and commercial software. The choice and use of these tools for sequence alignment through the complete interpretation of alignment results is often considered non-trivial by end-users with limited skill in Bioinformatics algorithm development. Here, we discuss the comparison of sequence alignment techniques based on dynamic programming (N-W, S-W) and heuristics (LFASTA, BL2SEQ) for four sets of sequence data towards an educational purpose. The analysis suggests that heuristics based methods are faster than dynamic programming methods in alignment speed.

The fast development of next-generation sequencing technology presents a major computational challenge for data processing and analysis. A fast algorithm, de Bruijn graph has been successfully used for genome DNA de novo assembly; nevertheless, its performance for transcriptome assembly is unclear. In this study, we used both simulated and real RNA-Seq data, from either artificial RNA templates or human transcripts, to evaluate five de novo assemblers, ABySS, Mira, Trinity, Velvet and Oases. Of these assemblers, ABySS, Trinity, Velvet and Oases are all based on de Bruijn graph, and Mira uses an overlap graph algorithm. Various numbers of RNA short reads were selected from the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) data and human chromosome 22. A number of statistics were then calculated for the resulting contigs from each assembler. Each experiment was repeated multiple times to obtain the mean statistics and standard error estimate. Trinity had relative good performance for both ERCC and human data, but it may not consistently generate full length transcripts. ABySS was the fastest method but its assembly quality was low. Mira gave a good rate for mapping its contigs onto human chromosome 22, but its computational speed is not satisfactory. Our results suggest that transcript assembly remains a challenge problem for bioinformatics society. Therefore, a novel assembler is in need for assembling transcriptome data generated by next generation sequencing technique.

The development of accurate computational models of biological processes is fundamental to computational systems biology. These models are usually represented by mathematical expressions that rely heavily on the system parameters. The measurement of these parameters is often difficult. Therefore, they are commonly estimated by fitting the predicted model to the experimental data using optimization methods. The complexity and nonlinearity of the biological processes pose a significant challenge, however, to the development of accurate and fast optimization methods. We introduce a new hybrid optimization method incorporating the Firefly Algorithm and the evolutionary operation of the Differential Evolution method. The proposed method improves solutions by neighbourhood search using evolutionary procedures. Testing our method on models for the arginine catabolism and the negative feedback loop of the p53 signalling pathway, we found that it estimated the parameters with high accuracy and within a reasonable computation time compared to well-known approaches, including Particle Swarm Optimization, Nelder-Mead, and Firefly Algorithm. We have also verified the reliability of the parameters estimated by the method using an a posteriori practical identifiability test.

The current molecular data explosion poses new challenges for large-scale phylogenomic analyses that can comprise hundreds or even thousands of genes. A property that characterizes phylogenomic datasets is that they tend to be gappy, i.e. can contain taxa with (many and disparate) missing genes. In current phylogenomic analyses, this type of alignment gappyness that is induced by missing data frequently exceeds 90%. We present and implement a generally applicable mechanism that allows for reducing memory footprints of likelihood-based [maximum likelihood (ML) or Bayesian] phylogenomic analyses proportional to the amount of missing data in the alignment. We also introduce a set of algorithmic rules to efficiently conduct tree searches via subtree pruning and re-grafting moves using this mechanism. On a large phylogenomic DNA dataset with 2177 taxa, 68 genes and a gappyness of 90%, we achieve a memory footprint reduction from 9 GB down to 1 GB, a speedup for optimizing ML model parameters of 11, and accelerate the Subtree Pruning Regrafting tree search phase by factor 16. Thus, our approach can be deployed to improve efficiency for the two most important resources, CPU time and memory, by up to one order of magnitude.

In single particle analysis, two-dimensional (2-D) alignment is a fundamental step intended to put into register various particle projections of biological macromolecules collected at the electron microscope. The efficiency and quality of three-dimensional (3-D) structure reconstruction largely depends on the computational speed and alignment accuracy of this crucial step. In order to improve the performance of alignment, we introduce a new method that takes advantage of the highly accurate interpolation scheme based on the gridding method, a version of the nonuniform fast Fourier transform, and utilizes a multi-dimensional optimization algorithm for the refinement of the orientation parameters. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by using less than half of the sample points and taking twice the runtime, our new 2-D alignment method achieves dramatically better alignment accuracy than that based on quadratic interpolation. We also apply our method to image to volume registration, the key step in the single particle EM structure refinement protocol. We find that in this case the accuracy of the method not only surpasses the accuracy of the commonly used real-space implementation, but results are achieved in much shorter time, making gridding-based alignment a perfect candidate for efficient structure determination in single particle analysis.

Finding large deletions in genome sequences has become increasingly more useful in bioinformatics, such as in clinical research and diagnosis. Although there are a number of publically available next generation sequencing mapping and sequence alignment programs, these software packages do not correctly align fragments containing deletions larger than one kb. We present a fast alignment software package, BinaryPartialAlign, that can be used by wet lab scientists to find long structural variations in their experiments. For BinaryPartialAlign, we make use of the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm with a binary-search-based approach for alignment with large gaps that we called partial alignment. BinaryPartialAlign implementation is compared with other straight-forward applications of SW. Simulation results on mtDNA fragments demonstrate the effectiveness (runtime and accuracy) of the proposed method.

BRAT-BW is significantly more memory efficient and faster on longer reads than current state-of-the-art tools for BS-seq data, without compromising on accuracy.

The haplotype phasing problem tries to screen for phenotype associated genomic variations from millions of candidate data. Most of the current computer programs handle this problem with high requirements of computing power and memory. By replacing the computation-intensive step of constructing the maximum spanning tree with a heuristics of estimated initial haplotype, we released the WinHAP algorithm version 1.0, which outperforms the other algorithms in terms of both running speed and overall accuracy. This work further speeds up the WinHAP algorithm to version 2.0 (WinHAP2) by utilizing the divide-and-conquer strategy and the OpenMP parallel computing mode. WinHAP2 can phase 500 genotypes with 1,000,000 SNPs using just 12.8 MB in memory and 2.5 hours on a personal computer, whereas the other programs require unacceptable memory or running times. The parallel running mode further improves WinHAP2's running speed with several orders of magnitudes, compared with the other programs, including Beagle, SHAPEIT2 and 2SNP. WinHAP2 is an extremely fast haplotype phasing program which can handle a large-scale genotyping study with any number of SNPs in the current literature and at least in the near future.

SOAP2 is a significantly improved version of the short oligonucleotide alignment program that both reduces computer memory usage and increases alignment speed at an unprecedented rate. We used a Burrows Wheeler Transformation (BWT) compression index to substitute the seed strategy for indexing the reference sequence in the main memory. We tested it on the whole human genome and found that this new algorithm reduced memory usage from 14.7 to 5.4 GB and improved alignment speed by 20-30 times. SOAP2 is compatible with both single- and paired-end reads. Additionally, this tool now supports multiple text and compressed file formats.

Phylogenomic analyses involving whole-genome or multi-locus data often entail dealing with incongruent gene trees. In this paper, we consider two causes of such incongruence, namely, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization, and consider both parsimony and probabilistic criteria for dealing with them. Under the assumption of ILS, computing the probability of a gene tree given a species tree is a very hard problem. We present a heuristic for speeding up the computation, and demonstrate how it scales up computations to data sizes that are not feasible to analyze using current techniques, while achieving very good accuracy. Further, under the assumption of both ILS and hybridization, computing the probability of a gene tree and parsimoniously reconciling it with a phylogenetic network are both very hard problems. We present two exact algorithms for these two problems that speed up existing techniques significantly and enable analyses of much larger data sets than is currently feasible. Our heuristics and algorithms enable phylogenomic analyses of larger (in terms of numbers of taxa) data sets than is currently feasible. Further, our methods account for ILS and hybridization, thus allowing analyses of reticulate evolutionary histories.

Protein homology search can be accelerated with the use of bit-parallel algorithms in conjunction with constraints on the values contained in the scoring matrices. Trinary scoring matrices (containing only the values -1, 0, and 1) allow for significant acceleration without significant reduction in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) score of a Smith-Waterman search. Binary scoring matrices (containing the values 0 and 1) result in some reduction in ROC score, but result in even more acceleration. Binary scoring matrices and five-bit saturating scores can be used for fast prefilters to the Smith-Waterman algorithm. 
50.3690	7.4676	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599912	checked	Protein alignment algorithms with an efficient backtracking routine on multiple GPUs.	Pairwise sequence alignment methods are widely used in biological research. The increasing number of sequences is perceived as one of the upcoming challenges for sequence alignment methods in the nearest future. To overcome this challenge several GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computing approaches have been proposed lately. These solutions show a great potential of a GPU platform but in most cases address the problem of sequence database scanning and computing only the alignment score whereas the alignment itself is omitted. Thus, the need arose to implement the global and semiglobal Needleman-Wunsch, and Smith-Waterman algorithms with a backtracking procedure which is needed to construct the alignment. In this paper we present the solution that performs the alignment of every given sequence pair, which is a required step for progressive multiple sequence alignment methods, as well as for DNA recognition at the DNA assembly stage. Performed tests show that the implementation, with performance up to 6.3 GCUPS on a single GPU for affine gap penalties, is very efficient in comparison to other CPU and GPU-based solutions. Moreover, multiple GPUs support with load balancing makes the application very scalable. The article shows that the backtracking procedure of the sequence alignment algorithms may be designed to fit in with the GPU architecture. Therefore, our algorithm, apart from scores, is able to compute pairwise alignments. This opens a wide range of new possibilities, allowing other methods from the area of molecular biology to take advantage of the new computational architecture. Performed tests show that the efficiency of the implementation is excellent. Moreover, the speed of our GPU-based algorithms can be almost linearly increased when using more than one graphics card. 
60.7656	13.8891	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17470273	candidate	Lower bounds on multiple sequence alignment using exact 3-way alignment.	Multiple sequence alignment is fundamental. Exponential growth in computation time appears to be inevitable when an optimal alignment is required for many sequences. Exact costs of optimum alignments are therefore rarely computed. Consequently much effort has been invested in algorithms for alignment that are heuristic, or explore a restricted class of solutions. These give an upper bound on the alignment cost, but it is equally important to determine the quality of the solution obtained. In the absence of an optimal alignment with which to compare, lower bounds may be calculated to assess the quality of the alignment. As more effort is invested in improving upper bounds (alignment algorithms), it is therefore important to improve lower bounds as well. Although numerous cost metrics can be used to determine the quality of an alignment, many are based on sum-of-pairs (SP) measures and their generalizations. Two standard and two new methods are considered for using exact 2-way and 3-way alignments to compute lower bounds on total SP alignment cost; one new method fares well with respect to accuracy, while the other reduces the computation time. The first employs exhaustive computation of exact 3-way alignments, while the second employs an efficient heuristic to compute a much smaller number of exact 3-way alignments. Calculating all 3-way alignments exactly and computing their average improves lower bounds on sum of SP cost in v-way alignments. However judicious selection of a subset of all 3-way alignments can yield a further improvement with minimal additional effort. On the other hand, a simple heuristic to select a random subset of 3-way alignments (a random packing) yields accuracy comparable to averaging all 3-way alignments with substantially less computational effort. Calculation of lower bounds on SP cost (and thus the quality of an alignment) can be improved by employing a mixture of 3-way and 2-way alignments.

Since retention times of compounds in GC-MS chromatograms always vary slightly from chromatogram to chromatogram, it is necessary to align chromatograms before comparing them in metabolomics experiments. Several software programs have been developed to automate this process. Here we report a comparative evaluation of the performance of eight programs using prepared samples of mixtures of chemicals, and an extract of tomato vines spiked with three concentrations of a mixture of alkanes. The programs included in the comparison were SpectConnect, MetaboliteDetector 2.01a, MetAlign 041012, MZmine 2.0, TagFinder 04, XCMS Online 1.21.01, MeltDB and GAVIN. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS, chromatograms were aligned using the selected programs, and the resulting data matrices were preprocessed and submitted to principal components analysis. In the first trial, SpectConnect, MetAlign and MetaboliteDetector correctly identified ≥90% of the true positives. In the second trial, MetAlign and MetaboliteDetector correctly identified 87% and 81% of the true positives, respectively. In addition, in both trials &gt;90% of the peaks identified by MetAlign and MetaboliteDetector were true positives.

Based on statistical thermodynamics or Michaelis -Menten kinetics, molecular biological systems can be modeled by a system of nonlinear differential equations. The nonlinearity in the model stems from rational reaction rates whose numerator and denominator are linear in parameters. It is a nonlinear problem to estimate the parameters in such rational models of molecular biological systems. In principle, any nonlinear optimization methods such as Newton-Gauss method and its variants can be used to estimate parameters in the rational models. However, these methods may converge to a local minimum and be sensitive to the initial values. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate the parameters in the rational models of molecular biological systems. In the proposed method, the cost function in all parameters is first reduced to a cost function only in the parameters in the denominator by a separable theorem. Then the parameters in the denominator are estimated by minimizing this cost function using our proposed new iteration method. Finally, the parameters in the numerator are estimated by a well defined linear least squares formula. A simple gene regulatory system is used as an example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than the general nonlinear optimization methods in terms of the running time, robustness (insensitivity) to the initial values, and the accuracy of estimates. 
30.2502	20.9649	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18275003	checked	Does choice in model selection affect maximum likelihood analysis?	In order to have confidence in model-based phylogenetic analysis, the model of nucleotide substitution adopted must be selected in a statistically rigorous manner. Several model-selection methods are applicable to maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, including the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test (hLRT), Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and decision theory (DT), but their performance relative to empirical data has not been investigated thoroughly. In this study, we use 250 phylogenetic data sets obtained from TreeBASE to examine the effects that choice in model selection has on ML estimation of phylogeny, with an emphasis on optimal topology, bootstrap support, and hypothesis testing. We show that the use of different methods leads to the selection of two or more models for approximately 80% of the data sets and that the AIC typically selects more complex models than alternative approaches. Although ML estimation with different best-fit models results in incongruent tree topologies approximately 50% of the time, these differences are primarily attributable to alternative resolutions of poorly supported nodes. Furthermore, topologies and bootstrap values estimated with ML using alternative statistically supported models are more similar to each other than to topologies and bootstrap values estimated with ML under the Kimura two-parameter (K2P) model or maximum parsimony (MP). In addition, Swofford-Olsen-Waddell-Hillis (SOWH) tests indicate that ML trees estimated with alternative best-fit models are usually not significantly different from each other when evaluated with the same model. However, ML trees estimated with statistically supported models are often significantly suboptimal to ML trees made with the K2P model when both are evaluated with K2P, indicating that not all models perform in an equivalent manner. Nevertheless, the use of alternative statistically supported models generally does not affect tests of monophyletic relationships under either the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (S-H) or SOWH methods. Our results suggest that although choice in model selection has a strong impact on optimal tree topology, it rarely affects evolutionary inferences drawn from the data because differences are mainly confined to poorly supported nodes. Moreover, since ML with alternative best-fit models tends to produce more similar estimates of phylogeny than ML under the K2P model or MP, the use of any statistically based model-selection method is vastly preferable to forgoing the model-selection process altogether.

Next-generation sequencing has become the most widely used sequencing technology in genomics research, but it has inherent drawbacks when dealing with high-GC content genomes.

Here, we report that the unbiased and longer read length of SMRT sequencing markedly improved genome assembly with high GC content via gap filling and repeat resolution. 
125.6579	5.7698	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24955109	checked	Software for pre-processing Illumina next-generation sequencing short read sequences.	When compared to Sanger sequencing technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are hindered by shorter sequence read length, higher base-call error rate, non-uniform coverage, and platform-specific sequencing artifacts. These characteristics lower the quality of their downstream analyses, e.g. de novo and reference-based assembly, by introducing sequencing artifacts and errors that may contribute to incorrect interpretation of data. Although many tools have been developed for quality control and pre-processing of NGS data, none of them provide flexible and comprehensive trimming options in conjunction with parallel processing to expedite pre-processing of large NGS datasets. We developed ngsShoRT (next-generation sequencing Short Reads Trimmer), a flexible and comprehensive open-source software package written in Perl that provides a set of algorithms commonly used for pre-processing NGS short read sequences. We compared the features and performance of ngsShoRT with existing tools: CutAdapt, NGS QC Toolkit and Trimmomatic. We also compared the effects of using pre-processed short read sequences generated by different algorithms on de novo and reference-based assembly for three different genomes: Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c, and Escherichia coli O157 H7. Several combinations of ngsShoRT algorithms were tested on publicly available Illumina GA II, HiSeq 2000, and MiSeq eukaryotic and bacteria genomic short read sequences with the focus on removing sequencing artifacts and low-quality reads and/or bases. Our results show that across three organisms and three sequencing platforms, trimming improved the mean quality scores of trimmed sequences. Using trimmed sequences for de novo and reference-based assembly improved assembly quality as well as assembler performance. In general, ngsShoRT outperformed comparable trimming tools in terms of trimming speed and improvement of de novo and reference-based assembly as measured by assembly contiguity and correctness. Trimming of short read sequences can improve the quality of de novo and reference-based assembly and assembler performance. The parallel processing capability of ngsShoRT reduces trimming time and improves the memory efficiency when dealing with large datasets. We recommend combining sequencing artifacts removal, and quality score based read filtering and base trimming as the most consistent method for improving sequence quality and downstream assemblies. ngsShoRT source code, user guide and tutorial are available at http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/genomics/ngsShoRT/. ngsShoRT can be incorporated as a pre-processing step in genome and transcriptome assembly projects.

Microarray data are usually peppered with missing values due to various reasons. However, most of the downstream analyses for microarray data require complete datasets. Therefore, accurate algorithms for missing value estimation are needed for improving the performance of microarray data analyses. Although many algorithms have been developed, there are many debates on the selection of the optimal algorithm. The studies about the performance comparison of different algorithms are still incomprehensive, especially in the number of benchmark datasets used, the number of algorithms compared, the rounds of simulation conducted, and the performance measures used. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive comparison by using (I) thirteen datasets, (II) nine algorithms, (III) 110 independent runs of simulation, and (IV) three types of measures to evaluate the performance of each imputation algorithm fairly. First, the effects of different types of microarray datasets on the performance of each imputation algorithm were evaluated. Second, we discussed whether the datasets from different species have different impact on the performance of different algorithms. To assess the performance of each algorithm fairly, all evaluations were performed using three types of measures. Our results indicate that the performance of an imputation algorithm mainly depends on the type of a dataset but not on the species where the samples come from. In addition to the statistical measure, two other measures with biological meanings are useful to reflect the impact of missing value imputation on the downstream data analyses. Our study suggests that local-least-squares-based methods are good choices to handle missing values for most of the microarray datasets. In this work, we carried out a comprehensive comparison of the algorithms for microarray missing value imputation. Based on such a comprehensive comparison, researchers could choose the optimal algorithm for their datasets easily. Moreover, new imputation algorithms could be compared with the existing algorithms using this comparison strategy as a standard protocol. In addition, to assist researchers in dealing with missing values easily, we built a web-based and easy-to-use imputation tool, MissVIA (http://cosbi.ee.ncku.edu.tw/MissVIA), which supports many imputation algorithms. Once users upload a real microarray dataset and choose the imputation algorithms, MissVIA will determine the optimal algorithm for the users' data through a series of simulations, and then the imputed results can be downloaded for the downstream data analyses.

The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. http://maq.sourceforge.net.

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a useful tool in bioinformatics. Although many MSA algorithms have been developed, there is still room for improvement in accuracy and speed. In the alignment of a family of protein sequences, global MSA algorithms perform better than local ones in many cases, while local ones perform better than global ones when some sequences have long insertions or deletions (indels) relative to others. Many recent leading MSA algorithms have incorporated pairwise alignment information obtained from a mixture of sources into their scoring system to improve accuracy of alignment containing long indels. We propose a novel group-to-group sequence alignment algorithm that uses a piecewise linear gap cost. We developed a program called PRIME, which employs our proposed algorithm to optimize the well-defined sum-of-pairs score. PRIME stands for Profile-based Randomized Iteration MEthod. We evaluated PRIME and some recent MSA programs using BAliBASE version 3.0 and PREFAB version 4.0 benchmarks. The results of benchmark tests showed that PRIME can construct accurate alignments comparable to the most accurate programs currently available, including L-INS-i of MAFFT, ProbCons, and T-Coffee. PRIME enables users to construct accurate alignments without having to employ pairwise alignment information. PRIME is available at http://prime.cbrc.jp/.

In this work we study a phylogeny problem. That is, given a collection of organisms, we want to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the organisms. We are interested in inferring relationships between the organisms. For a number of reasonable biological hypotheses the problem becomes NP-hard. Besides that, the problem data is large enough to inhibit anyone using exact algorithms to solve, in practical computational time, real instances of the problem.

RNA-sequencing technologies provide a powerful tool for expression analysis at gene and isoform level, but accurate estimation of isoform abundance is still a challenge. Standard assumption of uniform read intensity would yield biased estimates when the read intensity is in fact non-uniform. The problem is that, without strong assumptions, the read intensity pattern is not identifiable from data observed in a single sample. We develop a joint statistical model that accounts for non-uniform isoform-specific read distribution and gene isoform expression estimation. The main challenge is in dealing with the large number of isoform-specific read distributions, which potentially are as many as the number of splice variants in the genome. A statistical regularization via a smoothing penalty is imposed to control the estimation. Also, for identifiability reasons, the method uses information across samples from the same region. We develop a fast and robust computational procedure based on the iterated-weighted least-squares algorithm, and apply it to simulated data and two real RNA-Seq datasets with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation. Empirical tests show that our model performs better than existing methods in terms of increasing precision in isoform-level estimation. We have implemented our method in an R package called Sequgio as a pipeline for fast processing of RNA-Seq data.

Due to the high complexity of biological data it is difficult to disentangle cellular processes relying only on intuitive interpretation of measurements. A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient. Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance. We provide a freely available open source software package that implements the algorithms and examples compared here.

Maximum parsimony (MP) methods aim to reconstruct the phylogeny of extant species by finding the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario using the species' genome data. MP methods are considered to be accurate, but they are also computationally expensive especially for a large number of species. Several disk-covering methods (DCMs), which decompose the input species to multiple overlapping subgroups (or disks), have been proposed to solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer way. We design a new DCM based on the spectral method and also develop the COGNAC (Comparing Orders of Genes using Novel Algorithms and high-performance Computers) software package. COGNAC uses the new DCM to reduce the phylogenetic tree search space and selects an output tree from the reduced search space based on the MP principle. We test the new DCM using gene order data and inversion distance. The new DCM not only reduces the number of candidate tree topologies but also excludes erroneous tree topologies which can be selected by original MP methods. Initial labeling of internal genomes affects the accuracy of MP methods using gene order data, and the new DCM enables more accurate initial labeling as well. COGNAC demonstrates superior accuracy as a consequence. We compare COGNAC with FastME and the combination of the state of the art DCM (Rec-I-DCM3) and GRAPPA. COGNAC clearly outperforms FastME in accuracy. COGNAC--using the new DCM--also reconstructs a much more accurate tree in significantly shorter time than GRAPPA with Rec-I-DCM3. 
15.0114	7.7680	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296485	candidate	Performance comparison between k-tuple distance and four model-based distances in phylogenetic tree reconstruction.	Phylogenetic tree reconstruction requires construction of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from sequences. Computationally, it is difficult to achieve an optimal MSA for many sequences. Moreover, even if an optimal MSA is obtained, it may not be the true MSA that reflects the evolutionary history of the underlying sequences. Therefore, errors can be introduced during MSA construction which in turn affects the subsequent phylogenetic tree construction. In order to circumvent this issue, we extend the application of the k-tuple distance to phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The k-tuple distance between two sequences is the sum of the differences in frequency, over all possible tuples of length k, between the sequences and can be estimated without MSAs. It has been traditionally used to build a fast 'guide tree' to assist the construction of MSAs. Using the 1470 simulated sets of sequences generated under different evolutionary scenarios, the neighbor-joining trees and BioNJ trees, we compared the performance of the k-tuple distance with four commonly used distance estimators including Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, F84 and Tamura-Nei. These four distance estimators fall into the category of model-based distance estimators, as each of them takes account of a specific substitution model in order to compute the distance between a pair of already aligned sequences. Results show that trees constructed from the k-tuple distance are more accurate than those from other distances most time; when the divergence between underlying sequences is high, the tree accuracy could be twice or higher using the k-tuple distance than other estimators. Furthermore, as the k-tuple distance voids the need for constructing an MSA, it can save tremendous amount of time for phylogenetic tree reconstructions when the data include a large number of sequences. 
26.7310	2.8213	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11473006	candidate	New approaches for reconstructing phylogenies from gene order data.	We report on new techniques we have developed for reconstructing phylogenies on whole genomes. Our mathematical techniques include new polynomial-time methods for bounding the inversion length of a candidate tree and new polynomial-time methods for estimating genomic distances which greatly improve the accuracy of neighbor-joining analyses. We demonstrate the power of these techniques through an extensive performance study based on simulating genome evolution under a wide range of model conditions. Combining these new tools with standard approaches (fast reconstruction with neighbor-joining, exploration of all possible refinements of strict consensus trees, etc.) has allowed us to analyze datasets that were previously considered computationally impractical. In particular, we have conducted a complete phylogenetic analysis of a subset of the Campanulaceae family, confirming various conjectures about the relationships among members of the subset and about the principal mechanism of evolution for their chloroplast genome. We give representative results of the extensive experimentation we conducted on both real and simulated datasets in order to validate and characterize our approaches. We find that our techniques provide very accurate reconstructions of the true tree topology even when the data are generated by processes that include a significant fraction of transpositions and when the data are close to saturation.

Next-generation DNA sequencing machines are generating an enormous amount of sequence data, placing unprecedented demands on traditional single-processor read-mapping algorithms. CloudBurst is a new parallel read-mapping algorithm optimized for mapping next-generation sequence data to the human genome and other reference genomes, for use in a variety of biological analyses including SNP discovery, genotyping and personal genomics. It is modeled after the short read-mapping program RMAP, and reports either all alignments or the unambiguous best alignment for each read with any number of mismatches or differences. This level of sensitivity could be prohibitively time consuming, but CloudBurst uses the open-source Hadoop implementation of MapReduce to parallelize execution using multiple compute nodes. CloudBurst's running time scales linearly with the number of reads mapped, and with near linear speedup as the number of processors increases. In a 24-processor core configuration, CloudBurst is up to 30 times faster than RMAP executing on a single core, while computing an identical set of alignments. Using a larger remote compute cloud with 96 cores, CloudBurst improved performance by &gt;100-fold, reducing the running time from hours to mere minutes for typical jobs involving mapping of millions of short reads to the human genome. CloudBurst is available open-source as a model for parallelizing algorithms with MapReduce at (http://cloudburst-bio.sourceforge.net/). 
19.9225	1.1495	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18787703	candidate	Probabilistic phylogenetic inference with insertions and deletions.	A fundamental task in sequence analysis is to calculate the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences and an evolutionary model describing how sequences change over time. However, the most widely used phylogenetic models only account for residue substitution events. We describe a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. Starting from a continuous Markov process, we construct a non-reversible generative (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new &quot;concordance test&quot; benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we show that the extended program dnamlepsilon improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. 
10.6541	25.4012	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18541057	candidate	A topological transformation in evolutionary tree search methods based on maximum likelihood combining p-ECR and neighbor joining.	Inference of evolutionary trees using the maximum likelihood principle is NP-hard. Therefore, all practical methods rely on heuristics. The topological transformations often used in heuristics are Nearest Neighbor Interchange (NNI), Subtree Prune and Regraft (SPR) and Tree Bisection and Reconnection (TBR). However, these topological transformations often fall easily into local optima, since there are not many trees accessible in one step from any given tree. Another more exhaustive topological transformation is p-Edge Contraction and Refinement (p-ECR). However, due to its high computation complexity, p-ECR has rarely been used in practice. To make the p-ECR move more efficient, this paper proposes a new method named p-ECRNJ. The main idea of p-ECRNJ is to use neighbor joining (NJ) to refine the unresolved nodes produced in p-ECR. Experiments with real datasets show that p-ECRNJ can find better trees than the best known maximum likelihood methods so far and can efficiently improve local topological transforms in reasonable time. 
17.5700	22.5818	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22876807	candidate	Coupling SIMD and SIMT architectures to boost performance of a phylogeny-aware alignment kernel.	Aligning short DNA reads to a reference sequence alignment is a prerequisite for detecting their biological origin and analyzing them in a phylogenetic context. With the PaPaRa tool we introduced a dedicated dynamic programming algorithm for simultaneously aligning short reads to reference alignments and corresponding evolutionary reference trees. The algorithm aligns short reads to phylogenetic profiles that correspond to the branches of such a reference tree. The algorithm needs to perform an immense number of pairwise alignments. Therefore, we explore vector intrinsics and GPUs to accelerate the PaPaRa alignment kernel. We optimized and parallelized PaPaRa on CPUs and GPUs. Via SSE 4.1 SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) intrinsics for x86 SIMD architectures and multi-threading, we obtained a 9-fold acceleration on a single core as well as linear speedups with respect to the number of cores. The peak CPU performance amounts to 18.1 GCUPS (Giga Cell Updates per Second) using all four physical cores on an Intel i7 2600 CPU running at 3.4 GHz. The average CPU performance (averaged over all test runs) is 12.33 GCUPS. We also used OpenCL to execute PaPaRa on a GPU SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) architecture. A NVIDIA GeForce 560 GPU delivered peak and average performance of 22.1 and 18.4 GCUPS respectively. Finally, we combined the SIMD and SIMT implementations into a hybrid CPU-GPU system that achieved an accumulated peak performance of 33.8 GCUPS. This accelerated version of PaPaRa (available at http://www.exelixis-lab.org/software.html) provides a significant performance improvement that allows for analyzing larger datasets in less time. We observe that state-of-the-art SIMD and SIMT architectures deliver comparable performance for this dynamic programming kernel when the &quot;competing programmer approach&quot; is deployed. Finally, we show that overall performance can be substantially increased by designing a hybrid CPU-GPU system with appropriate load distribution mechanisms.

Supertree methods allow to reconstruct large phylogenetic trees by combining smaller trees with overlapping leaf sets into one, more comprehensive supertree. The most commonly used supertree method, matrix representation with parsimony (MRP), produces accurate supertrees but is rather slow due to the underlying hard optimization problem. In this paper, we present an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of MRP and the polynomial supertree methods MinCut Supertree, Modified MinCut Supertree, Build-with-distances, PhySIC, PhySIC_IST, and super distance matrix. We consider both quality and resolution of the reconstructed supertrees. Our findings illustrate the tradeoff between accuracy and running time in supertree construction, as well as the pros and cons of voting- and veto-based supertree approaches. Based on our results, we make some general suggestions for supertree methods yet to come.

83.6049	63.5160	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22689772	checked	DACTAL: divide-and-conquer trees (almost) without alignments.	While phylogenetic analyses of datasets containing 1000-5000 sequences are challenging for existing methods, the estimation of substantially larger phylogenies poses a problem of much greater complexity and scale. We present DACTAL, a method for phylogeny estimation that produces trees from unaligned sequence datasets without ever needing to estimate an alignment on the entire dataset. DACTAL combines iteration with a novel divide-and-conquer approach, so that each iteration begins with a tree produced in the prior iteration, decomposes the taxon set into overlapping subsets, estimates trees on each subset, and then combines the smaller trees into a tree on the full taxon set using a new supertree method. We prove that DACTAL is guaranteed to produce the true tree under certain conditions. We compare DACTAL to SATé and maximum likelihood trees on estimated alignments using simulated and real datasets with 1000-27 643 taxa. Our studies show that on average DACTAL yields more accurate trees than the two-phase methods we studied on very large datasets that are difficult to align, and has approximately the same accuracy on the easier datasets. The comparison to SATé shows that both have the same accuracy, but that DACTAL achieves this accuracy in a fraction of the time. Furthermore, DACTAL can analyze larger datasets than SATé, including a dataset with almost 28 000 sequences. DACTAL source code and results of dataset analyses are available at www.cs.utexas.edu/users/phylo/software/dactal. 
69.5760	15.9752	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21447171	checked	DecGPU: distributed error correction on massively parallel graphics processing units using CUDA and MPI.	Next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the high-throughput production of sequence data (reads) at low cost. However, these reads are significantly shorter and more error-prone than conventional Sanger shotgun reads. This poses a challenge for the de novo assembly in terms of assembly quality and scalability for large-scale short read datasets. We present DecGPU, the first parallel and distributed error correction algorithm for high-throughput short reads (HTSRs) using a hybrid combination of CUDA and MPI parallel programming models. DecGPU provides CPU-based and GPU-based versions, where the CPU-based version employs coarse-grained and fine-grained parallelism using the MPI and OpenMP parallel programming models, and the GPU-based version takes advantage of the CUDA and MPI parallel programming models and employs a hybrid CPU+GPU computing model to maximize the performance by overlapping the CPU and GPU computation. The distributed feature of our algorithm makes it feasible and flexible for the error correction of large-scale HTSR datasets. Using simulated and real datasets, our algorithm demonstrates superior performance, in terms of error correction quality and execution speed, to the existing error correction algorithms. Furthermore, when combined with Velvet and ABySS, the resulting DecGPU-Velvet and DecGPU-ABySS assemblers demonstrate the potential of our algorithm to improve de novo assembly quality for de-Bruijn-graph-based assemblers. DecGPU is publicly available open-source software, written in CUDA C++ and MPI. The experimental results suggest that DecGPU is an effective and feasible error correction algorithm to tackle the flood of short reads produced by next-generation sequencing technologies.

Many applications of next-generation sequencing technologies involve anchoring of a sequence fragment or a tag onto a corresponding position on a reference genome assembly. Positional Hashing method, implemented in the Pash 2.0 program, is specifically designed for the task of high-volume anchoring. In this article we present multi-diagonal gapped kmer collation and other improvements introduced in Pash 2.0 that further improve accuracy and speed of Positional Hashing. The goal of this article is to show that gapped kmer matching with cross-diagonal collation suffices for anchoring across close evolutionary distances and for the purpose of human resequencing. We propose a benchmark for evaluating the performance of anchoring programs that captures key parameters in specific applications, including duplicative structure of genomes of humans and other species. We demonstrate speedups of up to tenfold in large-scale anchoring experiments achieved by PASH 2.0 when compared to BLAT, another similarity search program frequently used for anchoring.

The approach presented here is faster (over 20× for long reads) and more sensitive (over 98% in a wide range of read lengths) than the current state-of-the-art mappers.

83.9424	10.0004	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626517	candidate	Fast inexact mapping using advanced tree exploration on backward search methods.	Short sequence mapping methods for Next Generation Sequencing consist on a combination of seeding techniques followed by local alignment based on dynamic programming approaches. Most seeding algorithms are based on backward search alignment, using the Burrows Wheeler Transform, the Ferragina and Manzini Index or Suffix Arrays. All these backward search algorithms have excellent performance, but their computational cost highly increases when allowing errors. In this paper, we discuss an inexact mapping algorithm based on pruning strategies for search tree exploration over genomic data. The proposed algorithm achieves a 13x speed-up over similar algorithms when allowing 6 base errors, including insertions, deletions and mismatches. This algorithm can deal with 400 bps reads with up to 9 errors in a high quality Illumina dataset. In this example, the algorithm works as a preprocessor that reduces by 55% the number of reads to be aligned. Depending on the aligner the overall execution time is reduced between 20-40%. Although not intended as a complete sequence mapping tool, the proposed algorithm could be used as a preprocessing step to modern sequence mappers. This step significantly reduces the number reads to be aligned, accelerating overall alignment time. Furthermore, this algorithm could be used for accelerating the seeding step of already available sequence mappers. In addition, an out-of-core index has been implemented for working with large genomes on systems without expensive memory configurations. 
16.9307	14.4570	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17021931	candidate	Distance-based genome rearrangement phylogeny.	Evolution operates on whole genomes through direct rearrangements of genes, such as inversions, transpositions, and inverted transpositions, as well as through operations, such as duplications, losses, and transfers, that also affect the gene content of the genomes. Because these events are rare relative to nucleotide substitutions, gene order data offer the possibility of resolving ancient branches in the tree of life; the combination of gene order data with sequence data also has the potential to provide more robust phylogenetic reconstructions, since each can elucidate evolution at different time scales. Distance corrections greatly improve the accuracy of phylogeny reconstructions from DNA sequences, enabling distance-based methods to approach the accuracy of the more elaborate methods based on parsimony or likelihood at a fraction of the computational cost. This paper focuses on developing distance correction methods for phylogeny reconstruction from whole genomes. The main question we investigate is how to estimate evolutionary histories from whole genomes with equal gene content, and we present a technique, the empirically derived estimator (EDE), that we have developed for this purpose. We study the use of EDE on whole genomes with identical gene content, and we explore the accuracy of phylogenies inferred using EDE with the neighbor joining and minimum evolution methods under a wide range of model conditions. Our study shows that tree reconstruction under these two methods is much more accurate when based on EDE distances than when based on other distances previously suggested for whole genomes.

The efficient and accurate computation of P-values is an essential requirement for motif-finding and alignment tools. We show that the approximation algorithms used in two popular motif-finding programs, MEME and Consensus, can fail to accurately compute the P-value. We present two new algorithms: one for the evaluation of the P-values of a range of motif scores, and a faster one for the evaluation of the P-value of a single motif score. Both exhibit more reliability than existing algorithms, and the latter algorithm is comparable in speed to the fastest existing method.

163.1115	127.3775	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21934137	checked	SuperFine: fast and accurate supertree estimation.	Many research groups are estimating trees containing anywhere from a few thousands to hundreds of thousands of species, toward the eventual goal of the estimation of a Tree of Life, containing perhaps as many as several million leaves. These phylogenetic estimations present enormous computational challenges, and current computational methods are likely to fail to run even on data sets in the low end of this range. One approach to estimate a large species tree is to use phylogenetic estimation methods (such as maximum likelihood) on a supermatrix produced by concatenating multiple sequence alignments for a collection of markers; however, the most accurate of these phylogenetic estimation methods are extremely computationally intensive for data sets with more than a few thousand sequences. Supertree methods, which assemble phylogenetic trees from a collection of trees on subsets of the taxa, are important tools for phylogeny estimation where phylogenetic analyses based upon maximum likelihood (ML) are infeasible. In this paper, we introduce SuperFine, a meta-method that utilizes a novel two-step procedure in order to improve the accuracy and scalability of supertree methods. Our study, using both simulated and empirical data, shows that SuperFine-boosted supertree methods produce more accurate trees than standard supertree methods, and run quickly on very large data sets with thousands of sequences. Furthermore, SuperFine-boosted matrix representation with parsimony (MRP, the most well-known supertree method) approaches the accuracy of ML methods on supermatrix data sets under realistic conditions.

Remote homology detection is among the most intensively researched problems in bioinformatics. Currently discriminative approaches, especially kernel-based methods, provide the most accurate results. However, kernel methods also show several drawbacks: in many cases prediction of new sequences is computationally expensive, often kernels lack an interpretable model for analysis of characteristic sequence features, and finally most approaches make use of so-called hyperparameters which complicate the application of methods across different datasets. We introduce a feature vector representation for protein sequences based on distances between short oligomers. The corresponding feature space arises from distance histograms for any possible pair of K-mers. Our distance-based approach shows important advantages in terms of computational speed while on common test data the prediction performance is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods for protein remote homology detection. Furthermore the learnt model can easily be analyzed in terms of discriminative features and in contrast to other methods our representation does not require any tuning of kernel hyperparameters. Normalized kernel matrices for the experimental setup can be downloaded at www.gobics.de/thomas. Matlab code for computing the kernel matrices is available upon request. thomas@gobics.de, peter@gobics.de.

New high-throughput sequencing technologies have promoted the production of short reads with dramatically low unit cost. The explosive growth of short read datasets poses a challenge to the mapping of short reads to reference genomes, such as the human genome, in terms of alignment quality and execution speed. We present CUSHAW, a parallelized short read aligner based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) parallel programming model. We exploit CUDA-compatible graphics hardware as accelerators to achieve fast speed. Our algorithm uses a quality-aware bounded search approach based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini index to reduce the search space and achieve high alignment quality. Performance evaluation, using simulated as well as real short read datasets, reveals that our algorithm running on one or two graphics processing units achieves significant speedups in terms of execution time, while yielding comparable or even better alignment quality for paired-end alignments compared with three popular BWT-based aligners: Bowtie, BWA and SOAP2. CUSHAW also delivers competitive performance in terms of single-nucleotide polymorphism calling for an Escherichia coli test dataset. http://cushaw.sourceforge.net 
36.8785	22.7742	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26356857	candidate	Accelerating the Next Generation Long Read Mapping with the FPGA-Based System.	To compare the newly determined sequences against the subject sequences stored in the databases is a critical job in the bioinformatics. Fortunately, recent survey reports that the state-of-the-art aligners are already fast enough to handle the ultra amount of short sequence reads in the reasonable time. However, for aligning the long sequence reads (&gt;400 bp) generated by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, it is still quite inefficient with present aligners. Furthermore, the challenge becomes more and more serious as the lengths and the amounts of the sequence reads are both keeping increasing with the improvement of the sequencing technology. Thus, it is extremely urgent for the researchers to enhance the performance of the long read alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel FPGA-based system to improve the efficiency of the long read mapping. Compared to the state-of-the-art long read aligner BWA-SW, our accelerating platform could achieve a high performance with almost the same sensitivity. Experiments demonstrate that, for reads with lengths ranging from 512 up to 4,096 base pairs, the described system obtains a 10x -48x speedup for the bottleneck of the software. As to the whole mapping procedure, the FPGA-based platform could achieve a 1.8x -3:3x speedup versus the BWA-SW aligner, reducing the alignment cycles from weeks to days. 
94.3953	103.0980	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16293191	checked	Ancestral sequence alignment under optimal conditions.	Multiple genome alignment is an important problem in bioinformatics. An important subproblem used by many multiple alignment approaches is that of aligning two multiple alignments. Many popular alignment algorithms for DNA use the sum-of-pairs heuristic, where the score of a multiple alignment is the sum of its induced pairwise alignment scores. However, the biological meaning of the sum-of-pairs of pairs heuristic is not obvious. Additionally, many algorithms based on the sum-of-pairs heuristic are complicated and slow, compared to pairwise alignment algorithms. An alternative approach to aligning alignments is to first infer ancestral sequences for each alignment, and then align the two ancestral sequences. In addition to being fast, this method has a clear biological basis that takes into account the evolution implied by an underlying phylogenetic tree. In this study we explore the accuracy of aligning alignments by ancestral sequence alignment. We examine the use of both maximum likelihood and parsimony to infer ancestral sequences. Additionally, we investigate the effect on accuracy of allowing ambiguity in our ancestral sequences. We use synthetic sequence data that we generate by simulating evolution on a phylogenetic tree. We use two different types of phylogenetic trees: trees with a period of rapid growth followed by a period of slow growth, and trees with a period of slow growth followed by a period of rapid growth. We examine the alignment accuracy of four ancestral sequence reconstruction and alignment methods: parsimony, maximum likelihood, ambiguous parsimony, and ambiguous maximum likelihood. Additionally, we compare against the alignment accuracy of two sum-of-pairs algorithms: ClustalW and the heuristic of Ma, Zhang, and Wang. We find that allowing ambiguity in ancestral sequences does not lead to better multiple alignments. Regardless of whether we use parsimony or maximum likelihood, the success of aligning ancestral sequences containing ambiguity is very sensitive to the choice of gap open cost. Surprisingly, we find that using maximum likelihood to infer ancestral sequences results in less accurate alignments than when using parsimony to infer ancestral sequences. Finally, we find that the sum-of-pairs methods produce better alignments than all of the ancestral alignment methods. 
3.1262	6.2970	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20433723	candidate	Cgaln: fast and space-efficient whole-genome alignment.	Whole-genome sequence alignment is an essential process for extracting valuable information about the functions, evolution, and peculiarities of genomes under investigation. As available genomic sequence data accumulate rapidly, there is great demand for tools that can compare whole-genome sequences within practical amounts of time and space. However, most existing genomic alignment tools can treat sequences that are only a few Mb long at once, and no state-of-the-art alignment program can align large sequences such as mammalian genomes directly on a conventional standalone computer. We previously proposed the CGAT (Coarse-Grained AlignmenT) algorithm, which performs an alignment job in two steps: first at the block level and then at the nucleotide level. The former is &quot;coarse-grained&quot; alignment that can explore genomic rearrangements and reduce the sizes of the regions to be analyzed in the next step. The latter is detailed alignment within limited regions. In this paper, we present an update of the algorithm and the open-source program, Cgaln, that implements the algorithm. We compared the performance of Cgaln with those of other programs on whole genomic sequences of several bacteria and of some mammalian chromosome pairs. The results showed that Cgaln is several times faster and more memory-efficient than the best existing programs, while its sensitivity and accuracy are comparable to those of the best programs. Cgaln takes less than 13 hours to finish an alignment between the whole genomes of human and mouse in a single run on a conventional desktop computer with a single CPU and 2 GB memory. Cgaln is not only fast and memory efficient but also effective in coping with genomic rearrangements. Our results show that Cgaln is very effective for comparison of large genomes, especially of intact chromosomal sequences. We believe that Cgaln provides novel viewpoint for reducing computational complexity and will contribute to various fields of genome science.

Recent progress in DNA sequencing technologies calls for fast and accurate algorithms that can evaluate sequence similarity for a huge amount of short reads. Searching similar pairs from a string pool is a fundamental process of de novo genome assembly, genome-wide alignment and other important analyses. In this study, we designed and implemented an exact algorithm SlideSort that finds all similar pairs from a string pool in terms of edit distance. Using an efficient pattern growth algorithm, SlideSort discovers chains of common k-mers to narrow down the search. Compared to existing methods based on single k-mers, our method is more effective in reducing the number of edit distance calculations. In comparison to backtracking methods such as BWA, our method is much faster in finding remote matches, scaling easily to tens of millions of sequences.

93.5773	32.7742	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14980012	candidate	An Eulerian path approach to global multiple alignment for DNA sequences.	With the rapid increase in the dataset of genome sequences, the multiple sequence alignment problem is increasingly important and frequently involves the alignment of a large number of sequences. Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to improve the speed of computation and the quality of alignment. We introduce a novel approach that is fundamentally different from all currently available methods. Our motivation comes from the Eulerian method for fragment assembly in DNA sequencing that transforms all DNA fragments into a de Bruijn graph and then reduces sequence assembly to a Eulerian path problem. The paper focuses on global multiple alignment of DNA sequences, where entire sequences are aligned into one configuration. Our main result is an algorithm with almost linear computational speed with respect to the total size (number of letters) of sequences to be aligned. Five hundred simulated sequences (averaging 500 bases per sequence and as low as 70% pairwise identity) have been aligned within three minutes on a personal computer, and the quality of alignment is satisfactory. As a result, accurate and simultaneous alignment of thousands of long sequences within a reasonable amount of time becomes possible. Data from an Arabidopsis sequencing project is used to demonstrate the performance. 
20.3809	37.3800	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19426451	candidate	Using tree diversity to compare phylogenetic heuristics.	Evolutionary trees are family trees that represent the relationships between a group of organisms. Phylogenetic heuristics are used to search stochastically for the best-scoring trees in tree space. Given that better tree scores are believed to be better approximations of the true phylogeny, traditional evaluation techniques have used tree scores to determine the heuristics that find the best scores in the fastest time. We develop new techniques to evaluate phylogenetic heuristics based on both tree scores and topologies to compare Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3, two popular Maximum Parsimony search algorithms. Our results show that although Pauprat and Rec-I-DCM3 find the trees with the same best scores, topologically these trees are quite different. Furthermore, the Rec-I-DCM3 trees cluster distinctly from the Pauprat trees. In addition to our heatmap visualizations of using parsimony scores and the Robinson-Foulds distance to compare best-scoring trees found by the two heuristics, we also develop entropy-based methods to show the diversity of the trees found. Overall, Pauprat identifies more diverse trees than Rec-I-DCM3. Overall, our work shows that there is value to comparing heuristics beyond the parsimony scores that they find. Pauprat is a slower heuristic than Rec-I-DCM3. However, our work shows that there is tremendous value in using Pauprat to reconstruct trees-especially since it finds identical scoring but topologically distinct trees. Hence, instead of discounting Pauprat, effort should go in improving its implementation. Ultimately, improved performance measures lead to better phylogenetic heuristics and will result in better approximations of the true evolutionary history of the organisms of interest.

Nonlinear stochastic differential equation models with unobservable state variables are now widely used in analysis of PK/PD data. Unobservable state variables are usually estimated with extended Kalman filter (EKF), and the unknown pharmacokinetic parameters are usually estimated by maximum likelihood estimator. However, EKF is inadequate for nonlinear PK/PD models, and MLE is known to be biased downwards. A density-based Monte Carlo filter (DMF) is proposed to estimate the unobservable state variables, and a simulation-based M estimator is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in this paper, where a genetic algorithm is designed to search the optimal values of pharmacokinetic parameters. The performances of EKF and DMF are compared through simulations for discrete time and continuous time systems respectively, and it is found that the results based on DMF are more accurate than those given by EKF with respect to mean absolute error.

Fragment recruitment, a process of aligning sequencing reads to reference genomes, is a crucial step in metagenomic data analysis. The available sequence alignment programs are either slow or insufficient for recruiting metagenomic reads. We implemented an efficient algorithm, FR-HIT, for fragment recruitment. We applied FR-HIT and several other tools including BLASTN, MegaBLAST, BLAT, LAST, SSAHA2, SOAP2, BWA and BWA-SW to recruit four metagenomic datasets from different type of sequencers. On average, FR-HIT and BLASTN recruited significantly more reads than other programs, while FR-HIT is about two orders of magnitude faster than BLASTN. FR-HIT is slower than the fastest SOAP2, BWA and BWA-SW, but it recruited 1-5 times more reads. http://weizhongli-lab.org/frhit.

257.5675	742.3975	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701525	training	Comprehensive evaluation of protein structure alignment methods: scoring by geometric measures.	We report the largest and most comprehensive comparison of protein structural alignment methods. Specifically, we evaluate six publicly available structure alignment programs: SSAP, STRUCTAL, DALI, LSQMAN, CE and SSM by aligning all 8,581,970 protein structure pairs in a test set of 2930 protein domains specially selected from CATH v.2.4 to ensure sequence diversity. We consider an alignment good if it matches many residues, and the two substructures are geometrically similar. Even with this definition, evaluating structural alignment methods is not straightforward. At first, we compared the rates of true and false positives using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the CATH classification taken as a gold standard. This proved unsatisfactory in that the quality of the alignments is not taken into account: sometimes a method that finds less good alignments scores better than a method that finds better alignments. We correct this intrinsic limitation by using four different geometric match measures (SI, MI, SAS, and GSAS) to evaluate the quality of each structural alignment. With this improved analysis we show that there is a wide variation in the performance of different methods; the main reason for this is that it can be difficult to find a good structural alignment between two proteins even when such an alignment exists. We find that STRUCTAL and SSM perform best, followed by LSQMAN and CE. Our focus on the intrinsic quality of each alignment allows us to propose a new method, called &quot;Best-of-All&quot; that combines the best results of all methods. Many commonly used methods miss 10-50% of the good Best-of-All alignments. By putting existing structural alignments into proper perspective, our study allows better comparison of protein structures. By highlighting limitations of existing methods, it will spur the further development of better structural alignment methods. This will have significant biological implications now that structural comparison has come to play a central role in the analysis of experimental work on protein structure, protein function and protein evolution.

The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies is accompanied with the development of many whole-genome sequence assembly methods and software, especially for de novo fragment assembly. Due to the poor knowledge about the applicability and performance of these software tools, choosing a befitting assembler becomes a tough task. Here, we provide the information of adaptivity for each program, then above all, compare the performance of eight distinct tools against eight groups of simulated datasets from Solexa sequencing platform. Considering the computational time, maximum random access memory (RAM) occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which SOAPdenovo is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential information for the improvement of existing assemblers or the developing of novel assemblers.

Because of ever-increasing throughput requirements of sequencing data, most existing short-read aligners have been designed to focus on speed at the expense of accuracy.

26.9834	2.3188	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18428768	candidate	Getting a tree fast: Neighbor Joining, FastME, and distance-based methods.	Neighbor Joining (NJ), FastME, and other distance-based programs including BIONJ, WEIGHBOR, and (to some extent) FITCH, are fast methods to build phylogenetic trees. This makes them particularly effective for large-scale studies or for bootstrap analysis, which require runs on multiple data sets. Like maximum likelihood methods, distance methods are based on a sequence evolution model that is used to estimate the matrix of pairwise evolutionary distances. Computer simulations indicate that the topological accuracy of FastME is best, followed by FITCH, WEIGHBOR, and BIONJ, while NJ is worse. Moreover, FastME is even faster than NJ with large data sets. Best-distance methods are equivalent to parsimony in most cases, but become more accurate when the molecular clock is strongly violated or in the presence of long (e.g., outgroup) branches. This unit describes how to use distance-based methods, focusing on NJ (the most popular) and FastME (the most efficient today). It also describes how to estimate evolutionary distances from DNA and proteins, how to perform bootstrap analysis, and how to use CLUSTAL to compute both a sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree. 
61.6041	22.9065	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380957	candidate	Joint amalgamation of most parsimonious reconciled gene trees.	Traditionally, gene phylogenies have been reconstructed solely on the basis of molecular sequences; this, however, often does not provide enough information to distinguish between statistically equivalent relationships. To address this problem, several recent methods have incorporated information on the species phylogeny in gene tree reconstruction, leading to dramatic improvements in accuracy. Although probabilistic methods are able to estimate all model parameters but are computationally expensive, parsimony methods-generally computationally more efficient-require a prior estimate of parameters and of the statistical support. Here, we present the Tree Estimation using Reconciliation (TERA) algorithm, a parsimony based, species tree aware method for gene tree reconstruction based on a scoring scheme combining duplication, transfer and loss costs with an estimate of the sequence likelihood. TERA explores all reconciled gene trees that can be amalgamated from a sample of gene trees. Using a large scale simulated dataset, we demonstrate that TERA achieves the same accuracy as the corresponding probabilistic method while being faster, and outperforms other parsimony-based methods in both accuracy and speed. Running TERA on a set of 1099 homologous gene families from complete cyanobacterial genomes, we find that incorporating knowledge of the species tree results in a two thirds reduction in the number of apparent transfer events. 
41.5751	13.2404	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21296750	candidate	SIMA: simultaneous multiple alignment of LC/MS peak lists.	Alignment of multiple liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) experiments is a necessity today, which arises from the need for biological and technical repeats. Due to limits in sampling frequency and poor reproducibility of retention times, current LC systems suffer from missing observations and non-linear distortions of the retention times across runs. Existing approaches for peak correspondence estimation focus almost exclusively on solving the pairwise alignment problem, yielding straightforward but suboptimal results for multiple alignment problems. We propose SIMA, a novel automated procedure for alignment of peak lists from multiple LC/MS runs. SIMA combines hierarchical pairwise correspondence estimation with simultaneous alignment and global retention time correction. It employs a tailored multidimensional kernel function and a procedure based on maximum likelihood estimation to find the retention time distortion function that best fits the observed data. SIMA does not require a dedicated reference spectrum, is robust with regard to outliers, needs only two intuitive parameters and naturally incorporates incomplete correspondence information. In a comparison with seven alternative methods on four different datasets, we show that SIMA yields competitive and superior performance on real-world data. A C++ implementation of the SIMA algorithm is available from http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/MIP/Software.

Molecular dynamics simulations have to be sufficiently long to draw reliable conclusions. However, no method exists to prove that a simulation has converged. We suggest the method of &quot;lagged RMSD-analysis&quot; as a tool to judge if an MD simulation has not yet run long enough. The analysis is based on RMSD values between pairs of configurations separated by variable time intervals Δt. Unless RMSD(Δt) has reached a stationary shape, the simulation has not yet converged.

The next-generation sequencing (NGS) revolution has drastically reduced time and cost requirements for sequencing of large genomes, and also qualitatively changed the problem of assembly. This article reviews the state of the art in de novo genome assembly, paying particular attention to mammalian-sized genomes. The strengths and weaknesses of the main sequencing platforms are highlighted, leading to a discussion of assembly and the new challenges associated with NGS data. Current approaches to assembly are outlined and the various software packages available are introduced and compared. The question of whether quality assemblies can be produced using short-read NGS data alone, or whether it must be combined with more expensive sequencing techniques, is considered. Prospects for future assemblers and tests of assembly performance are also discussed.

While the popular DNA sequence alignment tools incorporate powerful heuristics to allow for fast and accurate alignment of DNA, most of them still optimize the classical Needleman Wunsch scoring scheme. The development of novel scoring schemes is often hampered by the difficulty of finding an optimizing algorithm for each non-trivial scheme. In this paper we define the broad class of rectangle scoring schemes, and describe an algorithm and tool that can align two sequences with an arbitrary rectangle scoring scheme in polynomial time. Rectangle scoring schemes encompass some of the popular alignment scoring metrics currently in use, as well as many other functions. We investigate a novel scoring function based on minimizing the expected number of random diagonals observed with the given scores and show that it rivals the LAGAN and Clustal-W aligners, without using any biological or evolutionary parameters. The FRESCO program, freely available at http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/fresco, gives bioinformatics researchers the ability to quickly compare the performance of other complex scoring formulas without having to implement new algorithms to optimize them.

RNA-seq has been widely used for genome-wide expression profiling. RNA-seq data typically consists of tens of millions of short sequenced reads from different transcripts. However, due to sequence similarity among genes and among isoforms, the source of a given read is often ambiguous. Existing approaches for estimating expression levels from RNA-seq reads tend to compromise between accuracy and computational cost. We introduce a new approach for quantifying transcript abundance from RNA-seq data. EMSAR (Estimation by Mappability-based Segmentation And Reclustering) groups reads according to the set of transcripts to which they are mapped and finds maximum likelihood estimates using a joint Poisson model for each optimal set of segments of transcripts. The method uses nearly all mapped reads, including those mapped to multiple genes. With an efficient transcriptome indexing based on modified suffix arrays, EMSAR minimizes the use of CPU time and memory while achieving accuracy comparable to the best existing methods. EMSAR is a method for quantifying transcripts from RNA-seq data with high accuracy and low computational cost. EMSAR is available at https://github.com/parklab/emsar.

Second-generation sequencing (SGS) generates millions of reads that need to be aligned to a reference genome allowing errors. Although current aligners can efficiently map reads allowing a small number of mismatches, they are not well suited for handling a large number of mismatches. The efficiency of aligners can be improved using various heuristics, but the sensitivity and accuracy of the alignments are sacrificed. In this article, we introduce Basic Alignment tool for Mismatches (BatMis)--an efficient method to align short reads to a reference allowing k mismatches. BatMis is a Burrows-Wheeler transformation based aligner that uses a seed and extend approach, and it is an exact method. Benchmark tests show that BatMis performs better than competing aligners in solving the k-mismatch problem. Furthermore, it can compete favorably even when compared with the heuristic modes of the other aligners. BatMis is a useful alternative for applications where fast k-mismatch mappings, unique mappings or multiple mappings of SGS data are required.

We consider the problem of parameter estimation (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently, deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of realistic size within this class in reasonable computation times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods have shown promising results, although the computational cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have presented hybrid stochastic-deterministic GO methods which could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further reduce the computational effort without loosing robustness. We have developed a new procedure based on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this contribution, we describe and apply this novel metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field of operations research, to a set of complex identification problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to the previous (above mentioned) successful methods. Robust and efficient methods for parameter estimation are of key importance in systems biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while keeping the computational effort under reasonable values. This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear dynamic biological systems, outperforming very significantly all the methods previously used for these benchmark problems.

Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) is one of the high-throughput mass spectrometry technologies able to produce data requiring an extensive preprocessing before subsequent analyses. In this context, several low-level preprocessing techniques have been successfully developed for different tasks, including baseline correction, smoothing, normalisation, peak detection and peak alignment. In this work, we present a systematic comparison of different software packages aiding in the compulsory preprocessing of MALDI-TOF data. In order to guarantee the validity of our study, we test multiple configurations of each preprocessing technique that are subsequently used to train a set of classifiers whose performance (kappa and accuracy) provide us accurate information for the final comparison. Results from experiments show the real impact of preprocessing techniques on classification, evidencing that MassSpecWavelet provides the best performance and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are one of the most accurate classifiers. 
54.5561	28.6610	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20525601	candidate	Estimating species phylogenies using coalescence times among sequences.	The estimation of species trees (phylogenies) is one of the most important problems in evolutionary biology, and recently, there has been greater appreciation of the need to estimate species trees directly rather than using gene trees as a surrogate. A Bayesian method constructed under the multispecies coalescent model can consistently estimate species trees but involves intensive computation, which can hinder its application to the phylogenetic analysis of large-scale genomic data. Many summary statistics-based approaches, such as shallowest coalescences (SC) and Global LAteSt Split (GLASS), have been developed to infer species phylogenies for multilocus data sets. In this paper, we propose 2 methods, species tree estimation using average ranks of coalescences (STAR) and species tree estimation using average coalescence times (STEAC), based on the summary statistics of coalescence times. It can be shown that the 2 methods are statistically consistent under the multispecies coalescent model. STAR uses the ranks of coalescences and is thus resistant to variable substitution rates along the branches in gene trees. A simulation study suggests that STAR consistently outperforms STEAC, SC, and GLASS when the substitution rates among lineages are highly variable. Two real genomic data sets were analyzed by the 2 methods and produced species trees that are consistent with previous results. 
38.8854	5.7262	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22923295	candidate	RazerS 3: faster, fully sensitive read mapping.	During the past years, next-generation sequencing has become a key technology for many applications in the biomedical sciences. Throughput continues to increase and new protocols provide longer reads than currently available. In almost all applications, read mapping is a first step. Hence, it is crucial to have algorithms and implementations that perform fast, with high sensitivity, and are able to deal with long reads and a large absolute number of insertions and deletions. RazerS is a read mapping program with adjustable sensitivity based on counting q-grams. In this work, we propose the successor RazerS 3, which now supports shared-memory parallelism, an additional seed-based filter with adjustable sensitivity, a much faster, banded version of the Myers' bit-vector algorithm for verification, memory-saving measures and support for the SAM output format. This leads to a much improved performance for mapping reads, in particular, long reads with many errors. We extensively compare RazerS 3 with other popular read mappers and show that its results are often superior to them in terms of sensitivity while exhibiting practical and often competitive run times. In addition, RazerS 3 works without a pre-computed index. Source code and binaries are freely available for download at http://www.seqan.de/projects/razers. RazerS 3 is implemented in C++ and OpenMP under a GPL license using the SeqAn library and supports Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

A priori selection of models for use in phylogeny estimation from molecular sequence data is increasingly important as the number and complexity of available models increases. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the derivative decision-theoretic (DT) approaches rely on a conservative approximation to estimate the posterior probability of a given model. Here, we extended the DT method by using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches to directly estimate model probabilities for an extended candidate pool of all 406 special cases of the general time reversible + Γ family. We analyzed 250 diverse data sets in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the BIC approximation for model selection under the BIC and DT approaches. Model choice under DT differed between the BIC approximation and direct estimation methods for 45% of the data sets (113/250), and differing model choice resulted in significantly different sets of trees in the posterior distributions for 26% of the data sets (64/250). The model with the lowest BIC score differed from the model with the highest posterior probability in 30% of the data sets (76/250). When the data indicate a clear model preference, the BIC approximation works well enough to result in the same model selection as with directly estimated model probabilities, but a substantial proportion of biological data sets lack this characteristic, which leads to selection of underparametrized models. 
90.7633	49.5070	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857510	checked	Scoredist: a simple and robust protein sequence distance estimator.	Distance-based methods are popular for reconstructing evolutionary trees thanks to their speed and generality. A number of methods exist for estimating distances from sequence alignments, which often involves some sort of correction for multiple substitutions. The problem is to accurately estimate the number of true substitutions given an observed alignment. So far, the most accurate protein distance estimators have looked for the optimal matrix in a series of transition probability matrices, e.g. the Dayhoff series. The evolutionary distance between two aligned sequences is here estimated as the evolutionary distance of the optimal matrix. The optimal matrix can be found either by an iterative search for the Maximum Likelihood matrix, or by integration to find the Expected Distance. As a consequence, these methods are more complex to implement and computationally heavier than correction-based methods. Another problem is that the result may vary substantially depending on the evolutionary model used for the matrices. An ideal distance estimator should produce consistent and accurate distances independent of the evolutionary model used. We propose a correction-based protein sequence estimator called Scoredist. It uses a logarithmic correction of observed divergence based on the alignment score according to the BLOSUM62 score matrix. We evaluated Scoredist and a number of optimal matrix methods using three evolutionary models for both training and testing Dayhoff, Jones-Taylor-Thornton, and Muller-Vingron, as well as Whelan and Goldman solely for testing. Test alignments with known distances between 0.01 and 2 substitutions per position (1-200 PAM) were simulated using ROSE. Scoredist proved as accurate as the optimal matrix methods, yet substantially more robust. When trained on one model but tested on another one, Scoredist was nearly always more accurate. The Jukes-Cantor and Kimura correction methods were also tested, but were substantially less accurate. The Scoredist distance estimator is fast to implement and run, and combines robustness with accuracy. Scoredist has been incorporated into the Belvu alignment viewer, which is available at ftp://ftp.cgb.ki.se/pub/prog/belvu/.

27.9586	11.6734	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25963975	checked	Species Tree Inference Using a Mixture Model.	Species tree reconstruction has been a subject of substantial research due to its central role across biology and medicine. A species tree is often reconstructed using a set of gene trees or by directly using sequence data. In either of these cases, one of the main confounding phenomena is the discordance between a species tree and a gene tree due to evolutionary events such as duplications and losses. Probabilistic methods can resolve the discordance by coestimating gene trees and the species tree but this approach poses a scalability problem for larger data sets. We present MixTreEM-DLRS: A two-phase approach for reconstructing a species tree in the presence of gene duplications and losses. In the first phase, MixTreEM, a novel structural expectation maximization algorithm based on a mixture model is used to reconstruct a set of candidate species trees, given sequence data for monocopy gene families from the genomes under study. In the second phase, PrIME-DLRS, a method based on the DLRS model (Åkerborg O, Sennblad B, Arvestad L, Lagergren J. 2009. Simultaneous Bayesian gene tree reconstruction and reconciliation analysis. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 106(14):5714-5719), is used for selecting the best species tree. PrIME-DLRS can handle multicopy gene families since DLRS, apart from modeling sequence evolution, models gene duplication and loss using a gene evolution model (Arvestad L, Lagergren J, Sennblad B. 2009. The gene evolution model and computing its associated probabilities. J ACM. 56(2):1-44). We evaluate MixTreEM-DLRS using synthetic and biological data, and compare its performance with a recent genome-scale species tree reconstruction method PHYLDOG (Boussau B, Szöllősi GJ, Duret L, Gouy M, Tannier E, Daubin V. 2013. Genome-scale coestimation of species and gene trees. Genome Res. 23(2):323-330) as well as with a fast parsimony-based algorithm Duptree (Wehe A, Bansal MS, Burleigh JG, Eulenstein O. 2008. Duptree: a program for large-scale phylogenetic analyses using gene tree parsimony. Bioinformatics 24(13):1540-1541). Our method is competitive with PHYLDOG in terms of accuracy and runs significantly faster and our method outperforms Duptree in accuracy. The analysis constituted by MixTreEM without DLRS may also be used for selecting the target species tree, yielding a fast and yet accurate algorithm for larger data sets.

Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.

Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer. MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. MUSCLE is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.

Distance-based methods for phylogeny reconstruction are the fastest and easiest to use, and their popularity is accordingly high. They are also the only known methods that can cope with huge datasets of thousands of sequences. These methods rely on evolutionary distance estimation and are sensitive to errors in such estimations. In this study, a novel Bayesian method for estimation of evolutionary distances is developed. The proposed method enables the use of a sophisticated evolutionary model that better accounts for among-site rate variation (ASRV), thereby improving the accuracy of distance estimation. Rate variations are estimated within a Bayesian framework by extracting information from the entire dataset of sequences, unlike standard methods that can only use one pair of sequences at a time. We compare the accuracy of a cascade of distance estimation methods, starting from commonly used methods and moving towards the more sophisticated novel method. Simulation studies show significant improvements in the accuracy of distance estimation by the novel method over the commonly used ones. We demonstrate the effect of the improved accuracy on tree reconstruction using both real and simulated protein sequence alignments. An implementation of this method is available as part of the SEMPHY package.

Phylogenetic analysis has to overcome the grant challenge of inferring accurate species trees from evolutionary histories of gene families (gene trees) that are discordant with the species tree along whose branches they have evolved. Two well studied approaches to cope with this challenge are to solve either biologically informed gene tree parsimony (GTP) problems under gene duplication, gene loss, and deep coalescence, or the classic RF supertree problem that does not rely on any biological model. Despite the potential of these problems to infer credible species trees, they are NP-hard. Therefore, these problems are addressed by heuristics that typically lack any provable accuracy and precision. We describe fast dynamic programming algorithms that solve the GTP problems and the RF supertree problem exactly, and demonstrate that our algorithms can solve instances with data sets consisting of as many as 22 taxa. Extensions of our algorithms can also report the number of all optimal species trees, as well as the trees themselves. To better asses the quality of the resulting species trees that best fit the given gene trees, we also compute the worst case species trees, their numbers, and optimization score for each of the computational problems. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our exact algorithms using empirical and simulated data sets, and analyze the quality of heuristic solutions for the studied problems by contrasting them with our exact solutions.
