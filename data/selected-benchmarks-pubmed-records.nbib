AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have rapidly improved 
      our ability to study genomic material at an unprecedented scale. Despite substantial 
      improvements in sequencing technologies, errors present in the data still risk 
      confounding downstream analysis and limiting the applicability of sequencing 
      technologies in clinical tools. Computational error correction promises to eliminate 
      sequencing errors, but the relative accuracy of error correction algorithms remains 
      unknown. RESULTS: In this paper, we evaluate the ability of error correction 
      algorithms to fix errors across different types of datasets that contain various 
      levels of heterogeneity. We highlight the advantages and limitations of 
      computational error correction techniques across different domains of biology, 
      including immunogenomics and virology. To demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, 
      we apply the UMI-based high-fidelity sequencing protocol to eliminate sequencing 
      errors from both simulated data and the raw reads. We then perform a realistic 
      evaluation of error-correction methods. CONCLUSIONS: In terms of accuracy, we find 
      that method performance varies substantially across different types of datasets with 
      no single method performing best on all types of examined data. Finally, we also 
      identify the techniques that offer a good balance between precision and sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of whole exome sequencing (WES), an 
      increasing number of tools are being proposed for copy number variation (CNV) 
      detection based on this technique. However, no comprehensive guide is available for 
      the use of these tools in clinical settings, which renders them inapplicable in 
      practice. To resolve this problem, in this study, we evaluated the performances of 
      four WES-based CNV tools, and established a guideline for the recommendation of a 
      suitable tool according to the application requirements. RESULTS: In this study, 
      first, we selected four WES-based CNV detection tools: CoNIFER, cn.MOPS, CNVkit and 
      exomeCopy. Then, we evaluated their performances in terms of three aspects: 
      sensitivity and specificity, overlapping consistency and computational costs. From 
      this evaluation, we obtained four main results: (1) The sensitivity increases and 
      subsequently stabilizes as the coverage or CNV size increases, while the specificity 
      decreases. (2) CoNIFER performs better for CNV insertions than for CNV deletions, 
      while the remaining tools exhibit the opposite trend. (3) CoNIFER, cn.MOPS and 
      CNVkit realize satisfactory overlapping consistency, which indicates their results 
      are trustworthy. (4) CoNIFER has the best space complexity and cn.MOPS has the best 
      time complexity among these four tools. Finally, we established a guideline for 
      tools' usage according to these results. CONCLUSION: No available tool performs 
      excellently under all conditions; however, some tools perform excellently in some 
      scenarios. Users can obtain a CNV tool recommendation from our paper according to 
      the targeted CNV size, the CNV type or computational costs of their projects, as 
      presented in Table 1, which is helpful even for users with limited knowledge of 
      computer science.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated using 
      different technologies contain batch-specific systematic variations that present a 
      challenge to batch-effect removal and data integration. With continued growth 
      expected in scRNA-seq data, achieving effective batch integration with available 
      computational resources is crucial. Here, we perform an in-depth benchmark study on 
      available batch correction methods to determine the most suitable method for 
      batch-effect removal. RESULTS: We compare 14 methods in terms of computational 
      runtime, the ability to handle large datasets, and batch-effect correction efficacy 
      while preserving cell type purity. Five scenarios are designed for the study: 
      identical cell types with different technologies, non-identical cell types, multiple 
      batches, big data, and simulated data. Performance is evaluated using four 
      benchmarking metrics including kBET, LISI, ASW, and ARI. We also investigate the use 
      of batch-corrected data to study differential gene expression. CONCLUSION: Based on 
      our results, Harmony, LIGER, and Seurat 3 are the recommended methods for batch 
      integration. Due to its significantly shorter runtime, Harmony is recommended as the 
      first method to try, with the other methods as viable alternatives.

AB  - We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for inferring gene 
      regulatory networks from single-cell transcriptional data. As the ground truth for 
      assessing accuracy, we use synthetic networks with predictable trajectories, 
      literature-curated Boolean models and diverse transcriptional regulatory networks. 
      We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell transcriptional data from synthetic 
      and Boolean networks that avoids pitfalls of previously used methods. Furthermore, 
      we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We 
      develop an evaluation framework called BEELINE. We find that the area under the 
      precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The 
      methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean 
      models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also 
      perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require 
      pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate. Based on these results, we 
      present recommendations to end users. BEELINE will aid the development of gene 
      regulatory network inference algorithms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) are discovered to be tightly 
      associated with cancers, so accurately detecting them is one of the most important 
      tasks in the cancer genomics. A series of CNAs detection methods have been proposed 
      and new ones are still being developed. Due to the complexity of CNAs in cancers, no 
      CNAs detection method has been accepted as the gold standard caller. Several 
      evaluation works have made attempts to reveal typical CNAs detection methods' 
      performance. Limited by the scale of evaluation data, these different comparison 
      works don't reach a consensus and the researchers are still confused on how to 
      choose one proper CNAs caller for their analysis. Therefore, it needs a more 
      comprehensive evaluation of typical CNAs detection methods' performance. RESULTS: In 
      this work, we use a large-scale real dataset from CAGEKID consortium to evaluate 
      total 12 typical CNAs detection methods. These methods are most widely used in 
      cancer researches and always used as benchmark for the newly proposed CNAs detection 
      methods. This large-scale dataset comprises of SNP array data on 94 samples and the 
      whole genome sequencing data on 10 samples. Evaluations are comprehensively 
      implemented in current scenarios of CNAs detection, which include that detect CNAs 
      on SNP array data, on sequencing data with tumor and normal matched samples and on 
      sequencing data with single tumor sample. Three SNP based methods are firstly 
      ranked. Subsequently, the best SNP based method's results are used as benchmark to 
      compare six matched samples based methods and three single tumor sample based 
      methods in terms of the preprocessing, recall rate, Jaccard index and segmentation 
      characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey thoroughly reveals 12 typical methods' 
      superiority and inferiority. We explain why methods show specific characteristics 
      from a methodological standpoint. Finally, we present the guiding principle for 
      choosing one proper CNAs detection method under specific conditions. Some unsolved 
      problems and expectations are also addressed for upcoming CNAs detection methods.

AB  - Background: Data sets from long-read sequencing platforms (Oxford Nanopore 
      Technologies and Pacific Biosciences) allow for most prokaryote genomes to be 
      completely assembled - one contig per chromosome or plasmid. However, the high 
      per-read error rate of long-read sequencing necessitates different approaches to 
      assembly than those used for short-read sequencing. Multiple assembly tools 
      (assemblers) exist, which use a variety of algorithms for long-read assembly. 
      Methods: We used 500 simulated read sets and 120 real read sets to assess the 
      performance of eight long-read assemblers (Canu, Flye, Miniasm/Minipolish, NECAT, 
      NextDenovo/NextPolish, Raven, Redbean and Shasta) across a wide variety of genomes 
      and read parameters. Assemblies were assessed on their structural 
      accuracy/completeness, sequence identity, contig circularisation and computational 
      resources used. Results: Canu v2.0 produced reliable assemblies and was good with 
      plasmids, but it performed poorly with circularisation and had the longest runtimes 
      of all assemblers tested. Flye v2.8 was also reliable and made the smallest sequence 
      errors, though it used the most RAM. Miniasm/Minipolish v0.3/v0.1.3 was the most 
      likely to produce clean contig circularisation. NECAT v20200119 was reliable and 
      good at circularisation but tended to make larger sequence errors. 
      NextDenovo/NextPolish v2.3.0/v1.2.4 was reliable with chromosome assembly but bad 
      with plasmid assembly. Raven v1.1.10 was the most reliable for chromosome assembly, 
      though it did not perform well on small plasmids and had circularisation issues. 
      Redbean v2.5 and Shasta v0.5.1 were computationally efficient but more likely to 
      produce incomplete assemblies. Conclusions: Of the assemblers tested, Flye, 
      Miniasm/Minipolish and Raven performed best overall. However, no single tool 
      performed well on all metrics, highlighting the need for continued development on 
      long-read assembly algorithms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate fusion transcript detection is essential for comprehensive 
      characterization of cancer transcriptomes. Over the last decade, multiple 
      bioinformatic tools have been developed to predict fusions from RNA-seq, based on 
      either read mapping or de novo fusion transcript assembly. RESULTS: We benchmark 23 
      different methods including applications we develop, STAR-Fusion and TrinityFusion, 
      leveraging both simulated and real RNA-seq. Overall, STAR-Fusion, Arriba, and 
      STAR-SEQR are the most accurate and fastest for fusion detection on cancer 
      transcriptomes. CONCLUSION: The lower accuracy of de novo assembly-based methods 
      notwithstanding, they are useful for reconstructing fusion isoforms and tumor 
      viruses, both of which are important in cancer research.

PG  - e1007274

LID - e1007274
AB  - The popularity of CRISPR-based gene editing has resulted in an abundance of tools to 
      design CRISPR-Cas9 guides. This is also driven by the fact that designing highly 
      specific and efficient guides is a crucial, but not trivial, task in using CRISPR 
      for gene editing. Here, we thoroughly analyse the performance of 18 design tools. 
      They are evaluated based on runtime performance, compute requirements, and guides 
      generated. To achieve this, we implemented a method for auditing system resources 
      while a given tool executes, and tested each tool on datasets of increasing size, 
      derived from the mouse genome. We found that only five tools had a computational 
      performance that would allow them to analyse an entire genome in a reasonable time, 
      and without exhausting computing resources. There was wide variation in the guides 
      identified, with some tools reporting every possible guide while others filtered for 
      predicted efficiency. Some tools also failed to exclude guides that would target 
      multiple positions in the genome. We also considered two collections with over a 
      thousand guides each, for which experimental data is available. There is a lot of 
      variation in performance between the datasets, but the relative order of the tools 
      is partially conserved. Importantly, the most striking result is a lack of consensus 
      between the tools. Our results show that CRISPR-Cas9 guide design tools need further 
      work in order to achieve rapid whole-genome analysis and that improvements in guide 
      design will likely require combining multiple approaches.

AB  - In recent years, many software packages for identifying structural variants (SVs) 
      using whole-genome sequencing data have been released. When published, a new method 
      is commonly compared with those already available, but this tends to be selective 
      and incomplete. The lack of comprehensive benchmarking of methods presents 
      challenges for users in selecting methods and for developers in understanding 
      algorithm behaviours and limitations. Here we report the comprehensive evaluation of 
      10 SV callers, selected following a rigorous process and spanning the breadth of 
      detection approaches, using high-quality reference cell lines, as well as 
      simulations. Due to the nature of available truth sets, our focus is on 
      general-purpose rather than somatic callers. We characterise the impact on 
      performance of event size and type, sequencing characteristics, and genomic context, 
      and analyse the efficacy of ensemble calling and calibration of variant quality 
      scores. Finally, we provide recommendations for both users and methods developers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Structural variations (SVs) or copy number variations (CNVs) greatly 
      impact the functions of the genes encoded in the genome and are responsible for 
      diverse human diseases. Although a number of existing SV detection algorithms can 
      detect many types of SVs using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, no single 
      algorithm can call every type of SVs with high precision and high recall. RESULTS: 
      We comprehensively evaluate the performance of 69 existing SV detection algorithms 
      using multiple simulated and real WGS datasets. The results highlight a subset of 
      algorithms that accurately call SVs depending on specific types and size ranges of 
      the SVs and that accurately determine breakpoints, sizes, and genotypes of the SVs. 
      We enumerate potential good algorithms for each SV category, among which GRIDSS, 
      Lumpy, SVseq2, SoftSV, Manta, and Wham are better algorithms in deletion or 
      duplication categories. To improve the accuracy of SV calling, we systematically 
      evaluate the accuracy of overlapping calls between possible combinations of 
      algorithms for every type and size range of SVs. The results demonstrate that both 
      the precision and recall for overlapping calls vary depending on the combinations of 
      specific algorithms rather than the combinations of methods used in the algorithms. 
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that careful selection of the algorithms for each 
      type and size range of SVs is required for accurate calling of SVs. The selection of 
      specific pairs of algorithms for overlapping calls promises to effectively improve 
      the SV detection accuracy.

AB  - Recently, copy number variation (CNV) has gained considerable interest as a type of 
      genomic variation that plays an important role in complex phenotypes and disease 
      susceptibility. Since a number of CNV detection methods have recently been 
      developed, it is necessary to help investigators choose suitable methods for CNV 
      detection depending on their objectives. For this reason, this study compared ten 
      commonly used CNV detection applications, including CNVnator, ReadDepth, RDXplorer, 
      LUMPY and Control-FREEC, benchmarking the applications by sensitivity, specificity 
      and computational demands. Taking the DGV gold standard variants as a standard 
      dataset, we evaluated the ten applications with real sequencing data at sequencing 
      depths from 5X to 50X. Among the ten methods benchmarked, LUMPY performs the best 
      for both high sensitivity and specificity at each sequencing depth. For the purpose 
      of high specificity, Canvas is also a good choice. If high sensitivity is preferred, 
      CNVnator and RDXplorer are better choices. Additionally, CNVnator and GROM-RD 
      perform well for low-depth sequencing data. Our results provide a comprehensive 
      performance evaluation for these selected CNV detection methods and facilitate 
      future development and improvement in CNV prediction methods.

TI  - De novo transcriptome assembly: A comprehensive cross-species comparison of 
      short-read RNA-Seq assemblers.
LID - 10.1093/gigascience/giz039 [doi]
LID - giz039
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, massively parallel complementary DNA sequencing (RNA 
      sequencing [RNA-Seq]) has emerged as a fast, cost-effective, and robust technology 
      to study entire transcriptomes in various manners. In particular, for non-model 
      organisms and in the absence of an appropriate reference genome, RNA-Seq is used to 
      reconstruct the transcriptome de novo. Although the de novo transcriptome assembly 
      of non-model organisms has been on the rise recently and new tools are frequently 
      developing, there is still a knowledge gap about which assembly software should be 
      used to build a comprehensive de novo assembly. RESULTS: Here, we present a 
      large-scale comparative study in which 10 de novo assembly tools are applied to 9 
      RNA-Seq data sets spanning different kingdoms of life. Overall, we built >200 single 
      assemblies and evaluated their performance on a combination of 20 biological-based 
      and reference-free metrics. Our study is accompanied by a comprehensive and 
      extensible Electronic Supplement that summarizes all data sets, assembly execution 
      instructions, and evaluation results. Trinity, SPAdes, and Trans-ABySS, followed by 
      Bridger and SOAPdenovo-Trans, generally outperformed the other tools compared. 
      Moreover, we observed species-specific differences in the performance of each 
      assembler. No tool delivered the best results for all data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      recommend a careful choice and normalization of evaluation metrics to select the 
      best assembling results as a critical step in the reconstruction of a comprehensive 
      de novo transcriptome assembly.

TI  - Evaluating Statistical Multiple Sequence Alignment in Comparison to Other Alignment 
      Methods on Protein Data Sets.
PG  - 396-411
LID - 10.1093/sysbio/syy068 [doi]
AB  - The estimation of multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences is a basic step 
      in many bioinformatics pipelines, including protein structure prediction, protein 
      family identification, and phylogeny estimation. Statistical coestimation of 
      alignments and trees under stochastic models of sequence evolution has long been 
      considered the most rigorous technique for estimating alignments and trees, but 
      little is known about the accuracy of such methods on biological benchmarks. We 
      report the results of an extensive study evaluating the most popular protein 
      alignment methods as well as the statistical coestimation method BAli-Phy on 1192 
      protein data sets from established benchmarks as well as on 120 simulated data sets. 
      Our study (which used more than 230 CPU years for the BAli-Phy analyses alone) shows 
      that BAli-Phy has better precision and recall (with respect to the true alignments) 
      than the other alignment methods on the simulated data sets but has consistently 
      lower recall on the biological benchmarks (with respect to the reference alignments) 
      than many of the other methods. In other words, we find that BAli-Phy systematically 
      underaligns when operating on biological sequence data but shows no sign of this on 
      simulated data. There are several potential causes for this change in performance, 
      including model misspecification, errors in the reference alignments, and conflicts 
      between structural alignment and evolutionary alignments, and future research is 
      needed to determine the most likely explanation. We conclude with a discussion of 
      the potential ramifications for each of these possibilities. [BAli-Phy; homology; 
      multiple sequence alignment; protein sequences; structural alignment.].

LID - 10.1038/s41587-019-0071-9 [doi]
AB  - Trajectory inference approaches analyze genome-wide omics data from thousands of 
      single cells and computationally infer the order of these cells along developmental 
      trajectories. Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been 
      developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they 
      require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of 
      these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, 
      topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of 
      existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset 
      dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of 
      guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely 
      available data and evaluation pipeline ( https://benchmark.dynverse.org ) will aid 
      in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and 
      complex single-cell datasets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Third-generation sequencing technologies have advanced the progress of 
      the biological research by generating reads that are substantially longer than 
      second-generation sequencing technologies. However, their notorious high error rate 
      impedes straightforward data analysis and limits their application. A handful of 
      error correction methods for these error-prone long reads have been developed to 
      date. The output data quality is very important for downstream analysis, whereas 
      computing resources could limit the utility of some computing-intense tools. There 
      is a lack of standardized assessments for these long-read error-correction methods. 
      RESULTS: Here, we present a comparative performance assessment of ten 
      state-of-the-art error-correction methods for long reads. We established a common 
      set of benchmarks for performance assessment, including sensitivity, accuracy, 
      output rate, alignment rate, output read length, run time, and memory usage, as well 
      as the effects of error correction on two downstream applications of long reads: de 
      novo assembly and resolving haplotype sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account 
      all of these metrics, we provide a suggestive guideline for method choice based on 
      available data size, computing resources, and individual research goals.

TI  - Comparative analysis of differential gene expression analysis tools for single-cell 
      RNA sequencing data.
PG  - 40

AB  - BACKGROUND: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an 
      important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in 
      biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the 
      detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly 
      heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in 
      detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches 
      beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average 
      expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression 
      analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or 
      developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of 
      differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. RESULTS: In this 
      study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven 
      differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for 
      scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate 
      the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the 
      effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we 
      examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the 
      tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a 
      trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods 
      with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing 
      false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates 
      due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for 
      scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed 
      for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the 
      main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance 
      of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms 
      of the development of new methods.

TI  - Estimating the k-mer Coverage Frequencies in Genomic Datasets: A Comparative 
      Assessment of the State-of-the-art.
PG  - 2-15
LID - 10.2174/1389202919666181026101326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In bioinformatics, estimation of k-mer abundance histograms or just 
      enumerat-ing the number of unique k-mers and the number of singletons are desirable 
      in many genome sequence analysis applications. The applications include predicting 
      genome sizes, data pre-processing for de Bruijn graph assembly methods (tune runtime 
      parameters for analysis tools), repeat detection, sequenc-ing coverage estimation, 
      measuring sequencing error rates, etc. Different methods for cardinality estima-tion 
      in sequencing data have been developed in recent years. OBJECTIVE: In this article, 
      we present a comparative assessment of the different k-mer frequency estima-tion 
      programs (ntCard, KmerGenie, KmerStream and Khmer (abundance-dist-single.py and 
      unique-kmers.py) to assess their relative merits and demerits. METHODS: Principally, 
      the miscounts/error-rates of these tools are analyzed by rigorous experimental 
      analysis for a varied range of k. We also present experimental results on runtime, 
      scalability for larger datasets, memory, CPU utilization as well as parallelism of 
      k-mer frequency estimation methods. RESULTS: The results indicate that ntCard is 
      more accurate in estimating F0, f1 and full k-mer abundance histograms compared with 
      other methods. ntCard is the fastest but it has more memory requirements compared to 
      KmerGenie. CONCLUSION: The results of this evaluation may serve as a roadmap to 
      potential users and practitioners of streaming algorithms for estimating k-mer 
      coverage frequencies, to assist them in identifying an appro-priate method. Such 
      results analysis also help researchers to discover remaining open research 
      ques-tions, effective combinations of existing techniques and possible avenues for 
      future research.

TI  - Evaluation of Causal Structure Learning Methods on Mixed Data Types.
PG  - 48-65
AB  - Causal structure learning algorithms are very important in many fields, including 
      biomedical sciences, because they can uncover the underlying causal network 
      structure from observational data. Several such algorithms have been developed over 
      the years, but they usually operate on datasets of a single data type: continuous or 
      discrete variables only. More recently, we and others have proposed new causal 
      structure learning algorithms for mixed data types. However, to-date there is no 
      study that critically evaluates these methods' performance. In this paper, we 
      provide the first extensive empirical evaluation of several popular causal structure 
      learning methods on mixed data types and in a variety of parameter settings and 
      sample sizes. Our results serve as a guide as to which method performs the best in a 
      given context, and as such they are a first step towards a "method selection guide" 
      for those running causal modeling methods on real life datasets.

TI  - Performance evaluation method for read mapping tool in clinical panel sequencing.
PG  - 189-197
LID - 10.1007/s13258-017-0621-9 [doi]
AB  - In addition to the rapid advancement in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, 
      clinical panel sequencing is being used increasingly in clinical studies and tests. 
      However, tools that are used in NGS data analysis have not been comparatively 
      evaluated in performance for panel sequencing. This study aimed to evaluate the 
      tools used in the alignment process, the first procedure in bioinformatics analysis, 
      by comparing tools that have been widely used with ones that have been introduced 
      recently. With the accumulated panel sequencing data, detected variant lists were 
      cataloged and inserted into simulated reads produced from the reference genome 
      (h19). The amount of unmapped reads and misaligned reads, mapping quality 
      distribution, and runtime were measured as standards for comparison. As the most 
      widely used tools, Bowtie2 and BWA-MEM each showed explicit performance with AUC of 
      0.9984 and 0.9970 respectively. Kart, maintaining superior runtime and less number 
      of misaligned read, also similarly possessed high level of AUC (0.9723). Such 
      selection and optimization method of tools appropriate for panel sequencing can be 
      utilized for fields requiring error minimization, such as clinical application and 
      liquid biopsy studies.

TI  - Comprehensive benchmarking and ensemble approaches for metagenomic classifiers.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/s13059-017-1299-7 [doi]
LID - 182
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges in metagenomics is the identification of 
      microorganisms in clinical and environmental samples. While an extensive and 
      heterogeneous set of computational tools is available to classify microorganisms 
      using whole-genome shotgun sequencing data, comprehensive comparisons of these 
      methods are limited. RESULTS: In this study, we use the largest-to-date set of 
      laboratory-generated and simulated controls across 846 species to evaluate the 
      performance of 11 metagenomic classifiers. Tools were characterized on the basis of 
      their ability to identify taxa at the genus, species, and strain levels, quantify 
      relative abundances of taxa, and classify individual reads to the species level. 
      Strikingly, the number of species identified by the 11 tools can differ by over 
      three orders of magnitude on the same datasets. Various strategies can ameliorate 
      taxonomic misclassification, including abundance filtering, ensemble approaches, and 
      tool intersection. Nevertheless, these strategies were often insufficient to 
      completely eliminate false positives from environmental samples, which are 
      especially important where they concern medically relevant species. Overall, pairing 
      tools with different classification strategies (k-mer, alignment, marker) can 
      combine their respective advantages. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides positive and 
      negative controls, titrated standards, and a guide for selecting tools for 
      metagenomic analyses by comparing ranges of precision, accuracy, and recall. We show 
      that proper experimental design and analysis parameters can reduce false positives, 
      provide greater resolution of species in complex metagenomic samples, and improve 
      the interpretation of results.

AB  - Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) technology is a mid-length read, low-cost 
      and high-speed next-generation sequencing platform with a relatively high insertion 
      and deletion (indel) error rate. A full systematic assessment of the effectiveness 
      of various error correction algorithms in PGM viral datasets (e.g., hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV)) has not been performed. We examined 19 quality-trimmed PGM datasets for 
      the HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) region and found a total error rate of 
      0.48% ± 0.12%. Deletion errors were clearly present at the ends of homopolymer runs. 
      Tests using both real and simulated data showed that the algorithms differed in 
      their abilities to detect and correct errors and that the error rate and sequencing 
      depth significantly affected the performance. Of the algorithms tested, Pollux 
      showed a better overall performance but tended to over-correct 'genuine' 
      substitution variants, whereas Fiona proved to be better at distinguishing these 
      variants from sequencing errors. We found that the combined use of Pollux and Fiona 
      gave the best results when error-correcting Ion Torrent PGM viral data.

TI  - Benchmarking Relatedness Inference Methods with Genome-Wide Data from Thousands of 
      Relatives.
PG  - 75-82
LID - 10.1534/genetics.117.1122 [doi]
AB  - Inferring relatedness from genomic data is an essential component of genetic 
      association studies, population genetics, forensics, and genealogy. While numerous 
      methods exist for inferring relatedness, thorough evaluation of these approaches in 
      real data has been lacking. Here, we report an assessment of 12 state-of-the-art 
      pairwise relatedness inference methods using a data set with 2485 individuals 
      contained in several large pedigrees that span up to six generations. We find that 
      all methods have high accuracy (92-99%) when detecting first- and second-degree 
      relationships, but their accuracy dwindles to <43% for seventh-degree relationships. 
      However, most identical by descent (IBD) segment-based methods inferred 
      seventh-degree relatives correct to within one relatedness degree for >76% of 
      relative pairs. Overall, the most accurate methods are Estimation of Recent Shared 
      Ancestry (ERSA) and approaches that compute total IBD sharing using the output from 
      GERMLINE and Refined IBD to infer relatedness. Combining information from the most 
      accurate methods provides little accuracy improvement, indicating that novel 
      approaches, such as new methods that leverage relatedness signals from multiple 
      samples, are needed to achieve a sizeable jump in performance.

TI  - An evaluation of copy number variation detection tools for cancer using whole exome 
      sequencing data.
PG  - 286
LID - 10.1186/s12859-017-1705-x [doi]
LID - 286
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently copy number variation (CNV) has gained considerable interest as 
      a type of genomic/genetic variation that plays an important role in disease 
      susceptibility. Advances in sequencing technology have created an opportunity for 
      detecting CNVs more accurately. Recently whole exome sequencing (WES) has become 
      primary strategy for sequencing patient samples and study their genomics 
      aberrations. However, compared to whole genome sequencing, WES introduces more 
      biases and noise that make CNV detection very challenging. Additionally, tumors' 
      complexity makes the detection of cancer specific CNVs even more difficult. Although 
      many CNV detection tools have been developed since introducing NGS data, there are 
      few tools for somatic CNV detection for WES data in cancer. RESULTS: In this study, 
      we evaluated the performance of the most recent and commonly used CNV detection 
      tools for WES data in cancer to address their limitations and provide guidelines for 
      developing new ones. We focused on the tools that have been designed or have the 
      ability to detect cancer somatic aberrations. We compared the performance of the 
      tools in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate (FDR) using real data and 
      simulated data. Comparative analysis of the results of the tools showed that there 
      is a low consensus among the tools in calling CNVs. Using real data, tools show 
      moderate sensitivity (~50% - ~80%), fair specificity (~70% - ~94%) and poor FDRs 
      (~27% - ~60%). Also, using simulated data we observed that increasing the coverage 
      more than 10× in exonic regions does not improve the detection power of the tools 
      significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The limited performance of the current CNV detection 
      tools for WES data in cancer indicates the need for developing more efficient and 
      precise CNV detection methods. Due to the complexity of tumors and high level of 
      noise and biases in WES data, employing advanced novel segmentation, normalization 
      and de-noising techniques that are designed specifically for cancer data is 
      necessary. Also, CNV detection development suffers from the lack of a gold standard 
      for performance evaluation. Finally, developing tools with user-friendly user 
      interfaces and visualization features can enhance CNV studies for a broader range of 
      users.

TI  - Assessment of Common and Emerging Bioinformatics Pipelines for Targeted 
      Metagenomics.
PG  - e0169563
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0169563 [doi]
LID - e0169563
AB  - Targeted metagenomics, also known as metagenetics, is a high-throughput sequencing 
      application focusing on a nucleotide target in a microbiome to describe its 
      taxonomic content. A wide range of bioinformatics pipelines are available to analyze 
      sequencing outputs, and the choice of an appropriate tool is crucial and not 
      trivial. No standard evaluation method exists for estimating the accuracy of a 
      pipeline for targeted metagenomics analyses. This article proposes an evaluation 
      protocol containing real and simulated targeted metagenomics datasets, and adequate 
      metrics allowing us to study the impact of different variables on the biological 
      interpretation of results. This protocol was used to compare six different 
      bioinformatics pipelines in the basic user context: Three common ones (mothur, QIIME 
      and BMP) based on a clustering-first approach and three emerging ones (Kraken, CLARK 
      and One Codex) using an assignment-first approach. This study surprisingly reveals 
      that the effect of sequencing errors has a bigger impact on the results that 
      choosing different amplified regions. Moreover, increasing sequencing throughput 
      increases richness overestimation, even more so for microbiota of high complexity. 
      Finally, the choice of the reference database has a bigger impact on richness 
      estimation for clustering-first pipelines, and on correct taxa identification for 
      assignment-first pipelines. Using emerging assignment-first pipelines is a valid 
      approach for targeted metagenomics analyses, with a quality of results comparable to 
      popular clustering-first pipelines, even with an error-prone sequencing technology 
      like Ion Torrent. However, those pipelines are highly sensitive to the quality of 
      databases and their annotations, which makes clustering-first pipelines still the 
      only reliable approach for studying microbiomes that are not well described.

AB  - Alignment is the first step in most RNA-seq analysis pipelines, and the accuracy of 
      downstream analyses depends heavily on it. Unlike most steps in the pipeline, 
      alignment is particularly amenable to benchmarking with simulated data. We performed 
      a comprehensive benchmarking of 14 common splice-aware aligners for base, read, and 
      exon junction-level accuracy and compared default with optimized parameters. We 
      found that performance varied by genome complexity, and accuracy and popularity were 
      poorly correlated. The most widely cited tool underperforms for most metrics, 
      particularly when using default settings.

TI  - Benchmarking the next generation of homology inference tools.
PG  - 2636-41
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw305 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Over the last decades, vast numbers of sequences were deposited in 
      public databases. Bioinformatics tools allow homology and consequently functional 
      inference for these sequences. New profile-based homology search tools have been 
      introduced, allowing reliable detection of remote homologs, but have not been 
      systematically benchmarked. To provide such a comparison, which can guide 
      bioinformatics workflows, we extend and apply our previously developed benchmark 
      approach to evaluate the 'next generation' of profile-based approaches, including 
      CS-BLAST, HHSEARCH and PHMMER, in comparison with the non-profile based search tools 
      NCBI-BLAST, USEARCH, UBLAST and FASTA. METHOD: We generated challenging benchmark 
      datasets based on protein domain architectures within either the PFAM + Clan, 
      SCOP/Superfamily or CATH/Gene3D domain definition schemes. From each dataset, 
      homologous and non-homologous protein pairs were aligned using each tool, and 
      standard performance metrics calculated. We further measured congruence of domain 
      architecture assignments in the three domain databases. RESULTS: CSBLAST and PHMMER 
      had overall highest accuracy. FASTA, UBLAST and USEARCH showed large trade-offs of 
      accuracy for speed optimization. CONCLUSION: Profile methods are superior at 
      inferring remote homologs but the difference in accuracy between methods is 
      relatively small. PHMMER and CSBLAST stand out with the highest accuracy, yet still 
      at a reasonable computational cost. Additionally, we show that less than 0.1% of 
      Swiss-Prot protein pairs considered homologous by one database are considered 
      non-homologous by another, implying that these classifications represent equivalent 
      underlying biological phenomena, differing mostly in coverage and granularity.

TI  - Comparative assessment of methods for the fusion transcripts detection from RNA-Seq 
      data.
PG  - 21597

LID - 21597
AB  - RNA-Seq made possible the global identification of fusion transcripts, i.e. 
      "chimeric RNAs". Even though various software packages have been developed to serve 
      this purpose, they behave differently in different datasets provided by different 
      developers. It is important for both users, and developers to have an unbiased 
      assessment of the performance of existing fusion detection tools. Toward this goal, 
      we compared the performance of 12 well-known fusion detection software packages. We 
      evaluated the sensitivity, false discovery rate, computing time, and memory usage of 
      these tools in four different datasets (positive, negative, mixed, and test). We 
      conclude that some tools are better than others in terms of sensitivity, positive 
      prediction value, time consumption and memory usage. We also observed small overlaps 
      of the fusions detected by different tools in the real dataset (test dataset). This 
      could be due to false discoveries by various tools, but could also be due to the 
      reason that none of the tools are inclusive. We have found that the performance of 
      the tools depends on the quality, read length, and number of reads of the RNA-Seq 
      data. We recommend that users choose the proper tools for their purpose based on the 
      properties of their RNA-Seq data.

TI  - An evaluation of the accuracy and speed of metagenome analysis tools.
PG  - 19233
LID - 10.1038/srep19233 [doi]
LID - 19233
AB  - Metagenome studies are becoming increasingly widespread, yielding important insights 
      into microbial communities covering diverse environments from terrestrial and 
      aquatic ecosystems to human skin and gut. With the advent of high-throughput 
      sequencing platforms, the use of large scale shotgun sequencing approaches is now 
      commonplace. However, a thorough independent benchmark comparing state-of-the-art 
      metagenome analysis tools is lacking. Here, we present a benchmark where the most 
      widely used tools are tested on complex, realistic data sets. Our results clearly 
      show that the most widely used tools are not necessarily the most accurate, that the 
      most accurate tool is not necessarily the most time consuming, and that there is a 
      high degree of variability between available tools. These findings are important as 
      the conclusions of any metagenomics study are affected by errors in the predicted 
      community composition and functional capacity. Data sets and results are freely 
      available from http://www.ucbioinformatics.org/metabenchmark.html.

TI  - Evaluation of preprocessing, mapping and postprocessing algorithms for analyzing 
      whole genome bisulfite sequencing data.
PG  - 938-952
AB  - Cytosine methylation regulates many biological processes such as gene expression, 
      chromatin structure and chromosome stability. The whole genome bisulfite sequencing 
      (WGBS) technique measures the methylation level at each cytosine throughout the 
      genome. There are an increasing number of publicly available pipelines for analyzing 
      WGBS data, reflecting many choices of read mapping algorithms as well as 
      preprocessing and postprocessing methods. We simulated single-end and paired-end 
      reads based on three experimental data sets, and comprehensively evaluated 192 
      combinations of three preprocessing, five postprocessing and five widely used read 
      mapping algorithms. We also compared paired-end data with single-end data at the 
      same sequencing depth for performance of read mapping and methylation level 
      estimation. Bismark and LAST were the most robust mapping algorithms. We found that 
      Mott trimming and quality filtering individually improved the performance of both 
      read mapping and methylation level estimation, but combining them did not lead to 
      further improvement. Furthermore, we confirmed that paired-end sequencing reduced 
      error rate and enhanced sensitivity for both read mapping and methylation level 
      estimation, especially for short reads and in repetitive regions of the human 
      genome.

TI  - Evaluation of variant detection software for pooled next-generation sequence data.
PG  - 235
LID - 10.1186/s12859-015-0624-y [doi]
LID - 235
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the tremendous drop in the cost of nucleotide sequencing in 
      recent years, many research projects still utilize sequencing of pools containing 
      multiple samples for the detection of sequence variants as a cost saving measure. 
      Various software tools exist to analyze these pooled sequence data, yet little has 
      been reported on the relative accuracy and ease of use of these different programs. 
      RESULTS: In this manuscript we evaluate five different variant detection 
      programs-The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), CRISP, LoFreq, VarScan, and SNVer-with 
      regard to their ability to detect variants in synthetically pooled Illumina 
      sequencing data, by creating simulated pooled binary alignment/map (BAM) files using 
      single-sample sequencing data from varying numbers of previously characterized 
      samples at varying depths of coverage per sample. We report the overall runtimes and 
      memory usage of each program, as well as each program's sensitivity and specificity 
      to detect known true variants. CONCLUSIONS: GATK, CRISP, and LoFreq all gave 
      balanced accuracy of 80% or greater for datasets with varying per-sample depth of 
      coverage and numbers of samples per pool. VarScan and SNVer generally had balanced 
      accuracy lower than 80%. CRISP and LoFreq required up to four times less 
      computational time and up to ten times less physical memory than GATK did, and 
      without filtering, gave results with the highest sensitivity. VarScan and SNVer had 
      generally lower false positive rates, but also significantly lower sensitivity than 
      the other three programs.

TI  - WGBSSuite: simulating whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data and benchmarking 
      differential DNA methylation analysis tools.
PG  - 2371-3
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv114 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: As the number of studies looking at differences between DNA methylation 
      increases, there is a growing demand to develop and benchmark statistical methods to 
      analyse these data. To date no objective approach for the comparison of these 
      methods has been developed and as such it remains difficult to assess which analysis 
      tool is most appropriate for a given experiment. As a result, there is an unmet need 
      for a DNA methylation data simulator that can accurately reproduce a wide range of 
      experimental setups, and can be routinely used to compare the performance of 
      different statistical models. RESULTS: We have developed WGBSSuite, a flexible 
      stochastic simulation tool that generates single-base resolution DNA methylation 
      data genome-wide. Several simulator parameters can be derived directly from real 
      datasets provided by the user in order to mimic real case scenarios. Thus, it is 
      possible to choose the most appropriate statistical analysis tool for a given 
      simulated design. To show the usefulness of our simulator, we also report a 
      benchmark of commonly used methods for differential methylation analysis.

PG  - 509-13
LID - 10.1080/15476286.2015.1020269 [doi]
AB  - Most bacterial regulatory RNAs exert their function through base-pairing with target 
      RNAs. Computational prediction of targets is a busy research field that offers 
      biologists a variety of web sites and software. However, it is difficult for a 
      non-expert to evaluate how reliable those programs are. Here, we provide a simple 
      benchmark for bacterial sRNA target prediction based on trusted E. coli sRNA/target 
      pairs. We use this benchmark to assess the most recent RNA target predictors as well 
      as earlier programs for RNA-RNA hybrid prediction. Moreover, we consider how the 
      definition of mRNA boundaries can impact overall predictions. Recent algorithms that 
      exploit both conservation of targets and accessibility information offer improved 
      accuracy over previous software. However, even with the best predictors, the number 
      of true biological targets with low scores and non-targets with high scores remains 
      puzzling.

TI  - Comparisons of computational methods for differential alternative splicing detection 
      using RNA-seq in plant systems.
PG  - 364
LID - 10.1186/s12859-014-0364-4 [doi]
LID - 364
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alternative Splicing (AS) as a post-transcription regulation mechanism 
      is an important application of RNA-seq studies in eukaryotes. A number of software 
      and computational methods have been developed for detecting AS. Most of the methods, 
      however, are designed and tested on animal data, such as human and mouse. Plants 
      genes differ from those of animals in many ways, e.g., the average intron size and 
      preferred AS types. These differences may require different computational approaches 
      and raise questions about their effectiveness on plant data. The goal of this paper 
      is to benchmark existing computational differential splicing (or transcription) 
      detection methods so that biologists can choose the most suitable tools to 
      accomplish their goals. RESULTS: This study compares the eight popular public 
      available software packages for differential splicing analysis using both simulated 
      and real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data. All software are freely available. The 
      study examines the effect of varying AS ratio, read depth, dispersion pattern, AS 
      types, sample sizes and the influence of annotation. Using a real data, the study 
      looks at the consistences between the packages and verifies a subset of the detected 
      AS events using PCR studies. CONCLUSIONS: No single method performs the best in all 
      situations. The accuracy of annotation has a major impact on which method should be 
      chosen for AS analysis. DEXSeq performs well in the simulated data when the AS 
      signal is relative strong and annotation is accurate. Cufflinks achieve a better 
      tradeoff between precision and recall and turns out to be the best one when 
      incomplete annotation is provided. Some methods perform inconsistently for different 
      AS types. Complex AS events that combine several simple AS events impose problems 
      for most methods, especially for MATS. MATS stands out in the analysis of real 
      RNA-seq data when all the AS events being evaluated are simple AS events.

PG  - 205-17
LID - 10.4137/EBO.S19199 [doi]
AB  - A comparison of 10 most popular Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) tools, namely, 
      MUSCLE, MAFFT(L-INS-i), MAFFT (FFT-NS-2), T-Coffee, ProbCons, SATe, Clustal Omega, 
      Kalign, Multalin, and Dialign-TX is presented. We also focused on the significance 
      of some implementations embedded in algorithm of each tool. Based on 10 simulated 
      trees of different number of taxa generated by R, 400 known alignments and sequence 
      files were constructed using indel-Seq-Gen. A total of 4000 test alignments were 
      generated to study the effect of sequence length, indel size, deletion rate, and 
      insertion rate. Results showed that alignment quality was highly dependent on the 
      number of deletions and insertions in the sequences and that the sequence length and 
      indel size had a weaker effect. Overall, ProbCons was consistently on the top of 
      list of the evaluated MSA tools. SATe, being little less accurate, was 529.10% 
      faster than ProbCons and 236.72% faster than MAFFT(L-INS-i). Among other tools, 
      Kalign and MUSCLE achieved the highest sum of pairs. We also considered BALiBASE 
      benchmark datasets and the results relative to BAliBASE- and indel-Seq-Gen-generated 
      alignments were consistent in the most cases.

AB  - De novo genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a complete genomic sequence 
      from countless small sequencing reads. Due to the complexity of this task, numerous 
      genome assemblers have been developed to cope with different requirements and the 
      different kinds of data provided by sequencers within the fast evolving field of 
      next-generation sequencing technologies. In particular, the recently introduced 
      generation of benchtop sequencers, like Illumina's MiSeq and Ion Torrent's Personal 
      Genome Machine (PGM), popularized the easy, fast, and cheap sequencing of bacterial 
      organisms to a broad range of academic and clinical institutions. With a strong 
      pragmatic focus, here, we give a novel insight into the line of assembly evaluation 
      surveys as we benchmark popular de novo genome assemblers based on bacterial data 
      generated by benchtop sequencers. Therefore, single-library assemblies were 
      generated, assembled, and compared to each other by metrics describing assembly 
      contiguity and accuracy, and also by practice-oriented criteria as for instance 
      computing time. In addition, we extensively analyzed the effect of the depth of 
      coverage on the genome assemblies within reasonable ranges and the k-mer 
      optimization problem of de Bruijn Graph assemblers. Our results show that, although 
      both MiSeq and PGM allow for good genome assemblies, they require different 
      approaches. They not only pair with different assembler types, but also affect 
      assemblies differently regarding the depth of coverage where oversampling can become 
      problematic. Assemblies vary greatly with respect to contiguity and accuracy but 
      also by the requirement on the computing power. Consequently, no assembler can be 
      rated best for all preconditions. Instead, the given kind of data, the demands on 
      assembly quality, and the available computing infrastructure determines which 
      assembler suits best. The data sets, scripts and all additional information needed 
      to replicate our results are freely available at

TI  - Comparison of mapping algorithms used in high-throughput sequencing: application to 
      Ion Torrent data.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-15-264 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies has 
      opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of 
      large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in HTS data analysis is the 
      mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given 
      technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of 
      evaluating mapping algorithms. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a benchmark 
      procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in HTS using both real and simulated 
      datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time 
      requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in 
      repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To 
      measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read 
      taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the 
      end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed CuReSim, a new 
      read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of 
      HTS technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. CuReSim and CuReSimEval, 
      a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the CuReSim simulated reads, are freely 
      available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context 
      of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a 
      comparison has not yet been established. CONCLUSIONS: A benchmark procedure to 
      compare HTS data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping 
      correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping 
      quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome 
      sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and 
      demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended 
      application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark 
      procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to 
      optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing 
      platform.

TI  - Assessing the efficiency of multiple sequence alignment programs.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1748-7188-9-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for 
      molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms 
      available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment 
      accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have 
      not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced 
      by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale 
      data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, 
      a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical 
      indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of 
      nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, 
      MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment 
      dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each 
      program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard 
      scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, 
      and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of 
      execution. RESULTS: Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs 
      Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. 
      Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE 
      suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. 
      The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than 
      POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest 
      programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program. CONCLUSIONS: Based 
      on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and 
      MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. 
      T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, 
      which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the 
      BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of 
      alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in 
      a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly.

TI  - A benchmark for comparison of cell tracking algorithms.
PG  - 1609-17
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu080 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse fluorescence 
      microscopy is an important task in many biomedical applications. A novel framework 
      for objective evaluation of cell tracking algorithms has been established under the 
      auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell 
      Tracking Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods and 
      results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this 
      benchmark. RESULTS: The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of 
      a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures 
      for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms 
      covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and 
      ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the 
      diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. 
      Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately. 
      AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The challenge Web site 
      (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) provides access to the training 
      and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of the training videos. It 
      also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation 
      software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.

TI  - Assessment of de novo assemblers for draft genomes: a case study with fungal 
      genomes.
PG  - S10
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-15-S9-S10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, large bio-projects dealing with the release of different 
      genomes have transpired. Most of these projects use next-generation sequencing 
      platforms. As a consequence, many de novo assembly tools have evolved to assemble 
      the reads generated by these platforms. Each tool has its own inherent advantages 
      and disadvantages, which make the selection of an appropriate tool a challenging 
      task. RESULTS: We have evaluated the performance of frequently used de novo 
      assemblers namely ABySS, IDBA-UD, Minia, SOAP, SPAdes, Sparse, and Velvet. These 
      assemblers are assessed based on their output quality during the assembly process 
      conducted over fungal data. We compared the performance of these assemblers by 
      considering both computational as well as quality metrics. By analyzing these 
      performance metrics, the assemblers are ranked and a procedure for choosing the 
      candidate assembler is illustrated. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we propose an 
      assessment method for the selection of de novo assemblers by considering their 
      computational as well as quality metrics at the draft genome level. We divide the 
      quality metrics into three groups: g1 measures the goodness of the assemblies, g2 
      measures the problems of the assemblies, and g3 measures the conservation elements 
      in the assemblies. Our results demonstrate that the assemblers ABySS and IDBA-UD 
      exhibit a good performance for the studied data from fungal genomes in terms of 
      running time, memory, and quality. The results suggest that whole genome shotgun 
      sequencing projects should make use of different assemblers by considering their 
      merits.

LID - 472045
AB  - Background. Large-scale bisulfite treatment and short reads sequencing technology 
      allow comprehensive estimation of methylation states of Cs in the genomes of 
      different tissues, cell types, and developmental stages. Accurate characterization 
      of DNA methylation is essential for understanding genotype phenotype association, 
      gene and environment interaction, diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short 
      reads to a reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five bisulfite 
      short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker, BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing 
      two classes of mapping algorithms (hash table and suffix/prefix tries). We examined 
      their mapping efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to the 
      genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing default parameter 
      settings using both real and simulated reads. We also investigated how preprocessing 
      data might affect mapping efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, 
      in terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the real data, followed 
      by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and BS-Seeker with very similar performance. If 
      CPU time is not a constraint, Bismark is a good choice of program for mapping 
      bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal mapping efficiency. 
      Although increasing the number of mismatches allowed can increase mapping 
      efficiency, it not only significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk 
      of having increased false positives. Therefore, users should carefully set the 
      related parameters depending on the quality of their sequencing data.

TI  - Comparing memory-efficient genome assemblers on stand-alone and cloud

PG  - e75505

AB  - A fundamental problem in bioinformatics is genome assembly. Next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) technologies produce large volumes of fragmented genome reads, 
      which require large amounts of memory to assemble the complete genome efficiently. 
      With recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies, it is expected that the 
      memory footprint required for the assembly process will increase dramatically and 
      will emerge as a limiting factor in processing widely available NGS-generated reads. 
      In this report, we compare current memory-efficient techniques for genome assembly 
      with respect to quality, memory consumption and execution time. Our experiments 
      prove that it is possible to generate draft assemblies of reasonable quality on 
      conventional multi-purpose computers with very limited available memory by choosing 
      suitable assembly methods. Our study reveals the minimum memory requirements for 
      different assembly programs even when data volume exceeds memory capacity by orders 
      of magnitude. By combining existing methodologies, we propose two general assembly 
      strategies that can improve short-read assembly approaches and result in reduction 
      of the memory footprint. Finally, we discuss the possibility of utilizing cloud 
      infrastructures for genome assembly and we comment on some findings regarding 
      suitable computational resources for assembly.

TI  - Naive binning improves phylogenomic analyses.
PG  - 2277-84
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt394 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Species tree estimation in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting 
      (ILS) is a major challenge for phylogenomic analysis. Although many methods have 
      been developed for this problem, little is understood about the relative performance 
      of these methods when estimated gene trees are poorly estimated, owing to inadequate 
      phylogenetic signal. RESULTS: We explored the performance of some methods for 
      estimating species trees from multiple markers on simulated datasets in which gene 
      trees differed from the species tree owing to ILS. We included *BEAST, concatenated 
      analysis and several 'summary methods': BUCKy, MP-EST, minimize deep coalescence, 
      matrix representation with parsimony and the greedy consensus. We found that *BEAST 
      and concatenation gave excellent results, often with substantially improved accuracy 
      over the other methods. We observed that *BEAST's accuracy is largely due to its 
      ability to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree. However, *BEAST is 
      computationally intensive, making it challenging to run on datasets with 100 or more 
      genes or with more than 20 taxa. We propose a new approach to species tree 
      estimation in which the genes are partitioned into sets, and the species tree is 
      estimated from the resultant 'supergenes'. We show that this technique improves the 
      scalability of *BEAST without affecting its accuracy and improves the accuracy of 
      the summary methods. Thus, naive binning can improve phylogenomic analysis in the 
      presence of ILS. CONTACT: tandy@cs.utexas.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

TI  - Benchmarking short sequence mapping tools.
PG  - 184
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-14-184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of next-generation sequencing instruments has led to the 
      generation of millions of short sequences in a single run. The process of aligning 
      these reads to a reference genome is time consuming and demands the development of 
      fast and accurate alignment tools. However, the current proposed tools make 
      different compromises between the accuracy and the speed of mapping. Moreover, many 
      important aspects are overlooked while comparing the performance of a newly 
      developed tool to the state of the art. Therefore, there is a need for an objective 
      evaluation method that covers all the aspects. In this work, we introduce a 
      benchmarking suite to extensively analyze sequencing tools with respect to various 
      aspects and provide an objective comparison. RESULTS: We applied our benchmarking 
      tests on 9 well known mapping tools, namely, Bowtie, Bowtie2, BWA, SOAP2, MAQ, RMAP, 
      GSNAP, Novoalign, and mrsFAST (mrFAST) using synthetic data and real RNA-Seq data. 
      MAQ and RMAP are based on building hash tables for the reads, whereas the remaining 
      tools are based on indexing the reference genome. The benchmarking tests reveal the 
      strengths and weaknesses of each tool. The results show that no single tool 
      outperforms all others in all metrics. However, Bowtie maintained the best 
      throughput for most of the tests while BWA performed better for longer read lengths. 
      The benchmarking tests are not restricted to the mentioned tools and can be further 
      applied to others. CONCLUSION: The mapping process is still a hard problem that is 
      affected by many factors. In this work, we provided a benchmarking suite that 
      reveals and evaluates the different factors affecting the mapping process. Still, 
      there is no tool that outperforms all of the others in all the tests. Therefore, the 
      end user should clearly specify his needs in order to choose the tool that provides 
      the best results.

TI  - Comparative study of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly strategies for 
      transcriptome reconstruction based on RNA-Seq.
PG  - 143-55
LID - 10.1007/s11427-013-4442-z [doi]
AB  - Transcriptome reconstruction is an important application of RNA-Seq, providing 
      critical information for further analysis of transcriptome. Although RNA-Seq offers 
      the potential to identify the whole picture of transcriptome, it still presents 
      special challenges. To handle these difficulties and reconstruct transcriptome as 
      completely as possible, current computational approaches mainly employ two 
      strategies: de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly. In order to find the 
      similarities and differences between them, we firstly chose five representative 
      assemblers belonging to the two classes respectively, and then investigated and 
      compared their algorithm features in theory and real performances in practice. We 
      found that all the methods can be reduced to graph reduction problems, yet they have 
      different conceptual and practical implementations, thus each assembly method has 
      its specific advantages and disadvantages, performing worse than others in certain 
      aspects while outperforming others in anther aspects at the same time. Finally we 
      merged assemblies of the five assemblers and obtained a much better assembly. 
      Additionally we evaluated an assembler using genome-guided de novo assembly 
      approach, and achieved good performance. Based on these results, we suggest that to 
      obtain a comprehensive set of recovered transcripts, it is better to use a 
      combination of de novo assembly and genome-guided assembly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A fundamental problem in modern genomics is to taxonomically or 
      functionally classify DNA sequence fragments derived from environmental sampling 
      (i.e., metagenomics). Several different methods have been proposed for doing this 
      effectively and efficiently, and many have been implemented in software. In addition 
      to varying their basic algorithmic approach to classification, some methods screen 
      sequence reads for 'barcoding genes' like 16S rRNA, or various types of 
      protein-coding genes. Due to the sheer number and complexity of methods, it can be 
      difficult for a researcher to choose one that is well-suited for a particular 
      analysis. RESULTS: We divided the very large number of programs that have been 
      released in recent years for solving the sequence classification problem into three 
      main categories based on the general algorithm they use to compare a query sequence 
      against a database of sequences. We also evaluated the performance of the leading 
      programs in each category on data sets whose taxonomic and functional composition is 
      known. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant variability in classification accuracy, 
      precision, and resource consumption of sequence classification programs when used to 
      analyze various metagenomics data sets. However, we observe some general trends and 
      patterns that will be useful to researchers who use sequence classification 
      programs.

AB  - Mapping short reads against a reference genome is classically the first step of many 
      next-generation sequencing data analyses, and it should be as accurate as possible. 
      Because of the large number of reads to handle, numerous sophisticated algorithms 
      have been developped in the last 3 years to tackle this problem. In this article, we 
      first review the underlying algorithms used in most of the existing mapping tools, 
      and then we compare the performance of nine of these tools on a well controled 
      benchmark built for this purpose. We built a set of reads that exist in single or 
      multiple copies in a reference genome and for which there is no mismatch, and a set 
      of reads with three mismatches. We considered as reference genome both the human 
      genome and a concatenation of all complete bacterial genomes. On each dataset, we 
      quantified the capacity of the different tools to retrieve all the occurrences of 
      the reads in the reference genome. Special attention was paid to reads uniquely 
      reported and to reads with multiple hits.

PG  - 56-66
LID - 10.1093/bib/bbs015 [doi]
AB  - Error Correction is important for most next-generation sequencing applications 
      because highly accurate sequenced reads will likely lead to higher quality results. 
      Many techniques for error correction of sequencing data from next-gen platforms have 
      been developed in the recent years. However, compared with the fast development of 
      sequencing technologies, there is a lack of standardized evaluation procedure for 
      different error-correction methods, making it difficult to assess their relative 
      merits and demerits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of many 
      error-correction methods, and establish a common set of benchmark data and 
      evaluation criteria to provide a comparative assessment. We present experimental 
      results on quality, run-time, memory usage and scalability of several 
      error-correction methods. Apart from providing explicit recommendations useful to 
      practitioners, the review serves to identify the current state of the art and 
      promising directions for future research. AVAILABILITY: All error-correction 
      programs used in this article are downloaded from hosting websites. The evaluation 
      tool kit is publicly available at: http://aluru-sun.ece.iastate.edu/doku.php?id=ecr.

AB  - With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, many software 
      tools have emerged for the discovery of novel microRNAs (miRNAs) and for analyzing 
      the miRNAs expression profiles. An overall evaluation of these diverse software 
      tools is lacking. In this study, we evaluated eight software tools based on their 
      common feature and key algorithms. Three deep-sequencing data sets were collected 
      from different species and used to assess the computational time, sensitivity and 
      accuracy of detecting known miRNAs as well as their capacity for predicting novel 
      miRNAs. Our results provide useful information for researchers to facilitate their 
      selection of the optimal software tools for miRNA analysis depending on their 
      specific requirements, i.e. novel miRNAs discovery or miRNA expression profile 
      analysis of sequencing data sets.

TI  - Performance analysis of novel methods for detecting epistasis.
PG  - 475
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epistasis is recognized fundamentally important for understanding the 
      mechanism of disease-causing genetic variation. Though many novel methods for 
      detecting epistasis have been proposed, few studies focus on their comparison. 
      Undertaking a comprehensive comparison study is an urgent task and a pathway of the 
      methods to real applications. RESULTS: This paper aims at a comparison study of 
      epistasis detection methods through applying related software packages on datasets. 
      For this purpose, we categorize methods according to their search strategies, and 
      select five representative methods (TEAM, BOOST, SNPRuler, AntEpiSeeker and epiMODE) 
      originating from different underlying techniques for comparison. The methods are 
      tested on simulated datasets with different size, various epistasis models, and 
      with/without noise. The types of noise include missing data, genotyping error and 
      phenocopy. Performance is evaluated by detection power (three forms are introduced), 
      robustness, sensitivity and computational complexity. CONCLUSIONS: None of selected 
      methods is perfect in all scenarios and each has its own merits and limitations. In 
      terms of detection power, AntEpiSeeker performs best on detecting epistasis 
      displaying marginal effects (eME) and BOOST performs best on identifying epistasis 
      displaying no marginal effects (eNME). In terms of robustness, AntEpiSeeker is 
      robust to all types of noise on eME models, BOOST is robust to genotyping error and 
      phenocopy on eNME models, and SNPRuler is robust to phenocopy on eME models and 
      missing data on eNME models. In terms of sensitivity, AntEpiSeeker is the winner on 
      eME models and both SNPRuler and BOOST perform well on eNME models. In terms of 
      computational complexity, BOOST is the fastest among the methods. In terms of 
      overall performance, AntEpiSeeker and BOOST are recommended as the efficient and 
      effective methods. This comparison study may provide guidelines for applying the 
      methods and further clues for epistasis detection.

PG  - S4
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-S9-S4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Species phylogenies are not estimated directly, but rather through 
      phylogenetic analyses of different gene datasets. However, true gene trees can 
      differ from the true species tree (and hence from one another) due to biological 
      processes such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and gene 
      duplication and loss, so that no single gene tree is a reliable estimate of the 
      species tree. Several methods have been developed to estimate species trees from 
      estimated gene trees, differing according to the specific algorithmic technique used 
      and the biological model used to explain differences between species and gene trees. 
      Relatively little is known about the relative performance of these methods. RESULTS: 
      We report on a study evaluating several different methods for estimating species 
      trees from sequence datasets, simulating sequence evolution under a complex model 
      including indels (insertions and deletions), substitutions, and incomplete lineage 
      sorting. The most important finding of our study is that some fast and simple 
      methods are nearly as accurate as the most accurate methods, which employ 
      sophisticated statistical methods and are computationally quite intensive. We also 
      observe that methods that explicitly consider errors in the estimated gene trees 
      produce more accurate trees than methods that assume the estimated gene trees are 
      correct. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that highly accurate estimations of species 
      trees are achievable, even when gene trees differ from each other and from the 
      species tree, and that these estimations can be obtained using fairly simple and 
      computationally tractable methods.

TI  - Comparative analysis of algorithms for next-generation sequencing read alignment.
PG  - 2790-6
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr477 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques presents many 
      novel opportunities for many applications in life sciences. The vast number of short 
      reads produced by these techniques, however, pose significant computational 
      challenges. The first step in many types of genomic analysis is the mapping of short 
      reads to a reference genome, and several groups have developed dedicated algorithms 
      and software packages to perform this function. As the developers of these packages 
      optimize their algorithms with respect to various considerations, the relative 
      merits of different software packages remain unclear. However, for scientists who 
      generate and use NGS data for their specific research projects, an important 
      consideration is choosing the software that is most suitable for their application. 
      RESULTS: With a view to comparing existing short read alignment software, we develop 
      a simulation and evaluation suite, Seal, which simulates NGS runs for different 
      configurations of various factors, including sequencing error, indels and coverage. 
      We also develop criteria to compare the performances of software with disparate 
      output structure (e.g. some packages return a single alignment while some return 
      multiple possible alignments). Using these criteria, we comprehensively evaluate the 
      performances of Bowtie, BWA, mr- and mrsFAST, Novoalign, SHRiMP and SOAPv2, with 
      regard to accuracy and runtime. CONCLUSION: We expect that the results presented 
      here will be useful to investigators in choosing the alignment software that is most 
      suitable for their specific research aims. Our results also provide insights into 
      the factors that should be considered to use alignment results effectively. Seal can 
      also be used to evaluate the performance of algorithms that use deep sequencing data 
      for various purposes (e.g. identification of genomic variants). AVAILABILITY: Seal

LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Second generation sequencing technologies yield DNA sequence data at 
      ultra high-throughput. Common to most biological applications is a mapping of the 
      reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. The assessment of 
      the quality of read mapping results is not straightforward and has not been 
      formalized so far. Hence, it has not been easy to compare different read mapping 
      approaches in a unified way and to determine which program is the best for what 
      task. RESULTS: We present a new benchmark method, called Rabema (Read Alignment 
      BEnchMArk), for read mappers. It consists of a strict definition of the read mapping 
      problem and of tools to evaluate the result of arbitrary read mappers supporting the 
      SAM output format. CONCLUSIONS: We show the usefulness of the benchmark program by 
      performing a comparison of popular read mappers. The tools supporting the benchmark 
      are licensed under the GPL and available from 
      http://www.seqan.de/projects/rabema.html.

AB  - Next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have advanced 
      progressively in sequence-based genomic research and novel biological applications 
      with the promise of sequencing DNA at unprecedented speed. These new 
      non-Sanger-based technologies feature several advantages when compared with 
      traditional sequencing methods in terms of higher sequencing speed, lower per run 
      cost and higher accuracy. However, reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      platforms, such as 454/Roche, ABI/SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa, are usually short, 
      thereby restricting the applications of NGS platforms in genome assembly and 
      annotation. We presented an overview of the challenges that these novel technologies 
      meet and particularly illustrated various bioinformatics attempts on mapping and 
      assembly for problem solving. We then compared the performance of several programs 
      in these two fields, and further provided advices on selecting suitable tools for 
      specific biological applications.

AB  - Multiple comparison or alignmentof protein sequences has become a fundamental tool 
      in many different domains in modern molecular biology, from evolutionary studies to 
      prediction of 2D/3D structure, molecular function and inter-molecular interactions 
      etc. By placing the sequence in the framework of the overall family, multiple 
      alignments can be used to identify conserved features and to highlight differences 
      or specificities. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive evaluation of many of 
      the most popular methods for multiple sequence alignment (MSA), based on a new 
      benchmark test set. The benchmark is designed to represent typical problems 
      encountered when aligning the large protein sequence sets that result from today's 
      high throughput biotechnologies. We show that alignmentmethods have significantly 
      progressed and can now identify most of the shared sequence features that determine 
      the broad molecular function(s) of a protein family, even for divergent sequences. 
      However,we have identified a number of important challenges. First, the locally 
      conserved regions, that reflect functional specificities or that modulate a 
      protein's function in a given cellular context,are less well aligned. Second, motifs 
      in natively disordered regions are often misaligned. Third, the badly predicted or 
      fragmentary protein sequences, which make up a large proportion of today's 
      databases, lead to a significant number of alignment errors. Based on this study, we 
      demonstrate that the existing MSA methods can be exploited in combination to improve 
      alignment accuracy, although novel approaches will still be needed to fully explore 
      the most difficult regions. We then propose knowledge-enabled, dynamic solutions 
      that will hopefully pave the way to enhanced alignment construction and exploitation 
      in future evolutionary systems biology studies.

AB  - The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies is accompanied with the 
      development of many whole-genome sequence assembly methods and software, especially 
      for de novo fragment assembly. Due to the poor knowledge about the applicability and 
      performance of these software tools, choosing a befitting assembler becomes a tough 
      task. Here, we provide the information of adaptivity for each program, then above 
      all, compare the performance of eight distinct tools against eight groups of 
      simulated datasets from Solexa sequencing platform. Considering the computational 
      time, maximum random access memory (RAM) occupancy, assembly accuracy and integrity, 
      our study indicate that string-based assemblers, overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) 
      assemblers are well-suited for very short reads and longer reads of small genomes 
      respectively. For large datasets of more than hundred millions of short reads, De 
      Bruijn graph-based assemblers would be more appropriate. In terms of software 
      implementation, string-based assemblers are superior to graph-based ones, of which 
      SOAPdenovo is complex for the creation of configuration file. Our comparison study 
      will assist researchers in selecting a well-suited assembler and offer essential 
      information for the improvement of existing assemblers or the developing of novel 
      assemblers.

TI  - RAxML and FastTree: comparing two methods for large-scale maximum likelihood 
      phylogeny estimation.
PG  - e27731
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0027731 [doi]
LID - e27731
AB  - Statistical methods for phylogeny estimation, especially maximum likelihood (ML), 
      offer high accuracy with excellent theoretical properties. However, RAxML, the 
      current leading method for large-scale ML estimation, can require weeks or longer 
      when used on datasets with thousands of molecular sequences. Faster methods for ML 
      estimation, among them FastTree, have also been developed, but their relative 
      performance to RAxML is not yet fully understood. In this study, we explore the 
      performance with respect to ML score, running time, and topological accuracy, of 
      FastTree and RAxML on thousands of alignments (based on both simulated and 
      biological nucleotide datasets) with up to 27,634 sequences. We find that when RAxML 
      and FastTree are constrained to the same running time, FastTree produces 
      topologically much more accurate trees in almost all cases. We also find that when 
      RAxML is allowed to run to completion, it provides an advantage over FastTree in 
      terms of the ML score, but does not produce substantially more accurate tree 
      topologies. Interestingly, the relative accuracy of trees computed using FastTree 
      and RAxML depends in part on the accuracy of the sequence alignment and dataset 
      size, so that FastTree can be more accurate than RAxML on large datasets with 
      relatively inaccurate alignments. Finally, the running times of RAxML and FastTree 
      are dramatically different, so that when run to completion, RAxML can take several 
      orders of magnitude longer than FastTree to complete. Thus, our study shows that 
      very large phylogenies can be estimated very quickly using FastTree, with little 
      (and in some cases no) degradation in tree accuracy, as compared to RAxML.

TI  - Multiple sequence alignment: a major challenge to large-scale phylogenetics.
PG  - RRN1198
LID - RRN1198
AB  - Over the last decade, dramatic advances have been made in developing methods for 
      large-scale phylogeny estimation, so that it is now feasible for investigators with 
      moderate computational resources to obtain reasonable solutions to maximum 
      likelihood and maximum parsimony, even for datasets with a few thousand sequences. 
      There has also been progress on developing methods for multiple sequence alignment, 
      so that greater alignment accuracy (and subsequent improvement in phylogenetic 
      accuracy) is now possible through automated methods. However, these methods have not 
      been tested under conditions that reflect properties of datasets confronted by 
      large-scale phylogenetic estimation projects. In this paper we report on a study 
      that compares several alignment methods on a benchmark collection of nucleotide 
      sequence datasets of up to 78,132 sequences. We show that as the number of sequences 
      increases, the number of alignment methods that can analyze the datasets decreases. 
      Furthermore, the most accurate alignment methods are unable to analyze the very 
      largest datasets we studied, so that only moderately accurate alignment methods can 
      be used on the largest datasets. As a result, alignments computed for large datasets 
      have relatively large error rates, and maximum likelihood phylogenies computed on 
      these alignments also have high error rates. Therefore, the estimation of highly 
      accurate multiple sequence alignments is a major challenge for Tree of Life 
      projects, and more generally for large-scale systematics studies.

AB  - The most important way of conveying new findings in biomedical research is 
      scientific publication. Extraction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) reported 
      in scientific publications is one of the core topics of text mining in the life 
      sciences. Recently, a new class of such methods has been proposed - convolution 
      kernels that identify PPIs using deep parses of sentences. However, comparing 
      published results of different PPI extraction methods is impossible due to the use 
      of different evaluation corpora, different evaluation metrics, different tuning 
      procedures, etc. In this paper, we study whether the reported performance metrics 
      are robust across different corpora and learning settings and whether the use of 
      deep parsing actually leads to an increase in extraction quality. Our ultimate goal 
      is to identify the one method that performs best in real-life scenarios, where 
      information extraction is performed on unseen text and not on specifically prepared 
      evaluation data. We performed a comprehensive benchmarking of nine different methods 
      for PPI extraction that use convolution kernels on rich linguistic information. 
      Methods were evaluated on five different public corpora using cross-validation, 
      cross-learning, and cross-corpus evaluation. Our study confirms that kernels using 
      dependency trees generally outperform kernels based on syntax trees. However, our 
      study also shows that only the best kernel methods can compete with a simple 
      rule-based approach when the evaluation prevents information leakage between 
      training and test corpora. Our results further reveal that the F-score of many 
      approaches drops significantly if no corpus-specific parameter optimization is 
      applied and that methods reaching a good AUC score often perform much worse in terms 
      of F-score. We conclude that for most kernels no sensible estimation of PPI 
      extraction performance on new text is possible, given the current heterogeneity in 
      evaluation data. Nevertheless, our study shows that three kernels are clearly 
      superior to the other methods.

LID - 10.1186/1748-7188-5-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supertree methods comprise one approach to reconstructing large 
      molecular phylogenies given multi-marker datasets: trees are estimated on each 
      marker and then combined into a tree (the "supertree") on the entire set of taxa. 
      Supertrees can be constructed using various algorithmic techniques, with the most 
      common being matrix representation with parsimony (MRP). When the data allow, the 
      competing approach is a combined analysis (also known as a "supermatrix" or "total 
      evidence" approach) whereby the different sequence data matrices for each of the 
      different subsets of taxa are concatenated into a single supermatrix, and a tree is 
      estimated on that supermatrix. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe an extensive 
      simulation study we performed comparing two supertree methods, MRP and weighted MRP, 
      to combined analysis methods on large model trees. A key contribution of this study 
      is our novel simulation methodology (Super-Method Input Data Generator, or SMIDGen) 
      that better reflects biological processes and the practices of systematists than 
      earlier simulations. We show that combined analysis based upon maximum likelihood 
      outperforms MRP and weighted MRP, giving especially big improvements when the 
      largest subtree does not contain most of the taxa. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that MRP and weighted MRP produce distinctly less accurate trees than 
      combined analyses for a given base method (maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood). 
      Since there are situations in which combined analyses are not feasible, there is a 
      clear need for better supertree methods. The source tree and combined datasets used 
      in this study can be used to test other supertree and combined analysis methods.

      analysis.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-10-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomic data analysis, peak detection 
      is an essential step for subsequent analysis. Recently, there has been significant 
      progress in the development of various peak detection algorithms. However, neither a 
      comprehensive survey nor an experimental comparison of these algorithms is yet 
      available. The main objective of this paper is to provide such a survey and to 
      compare the performance of single spectrum based peak detection methods. RESULTS: In 
      general, we can decompose a peak detection procedure into three consequent parts: 
      smoothing, baseline correction and peak finding. We first categorize existing peak 
      detection algorithms according to the techniques used in different phases. Such a 
      categorization reveals the differences and similarities among existing peak 
      detection algorithms. Then, we choose five typical peak detection algorithms to 
      conduct a comprehensive experimental study using both simulation data and real MALDI 
      MS data. CONCLUSION: The results of comparison show that the continuous 
      wavelet-based algorithm provides the best average performance.

TI  - Barking up the wrong treelength: the impact of gap penalty on alignment and tree 
      accuracy.
PG  - 7-21
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2008.63 [doi]
AB  - Several methods have been developed for simultaneous estimation of alignment and 
      tree, of which POY is the most popular. In a 2007 paper published in Systematic 
      Biology, Ogden and Rosenberg reported on a simulation study in which they compared 
      POY to estimating the alignment using ClustalW and then analyzing the resultant 
      alignment using maximum parsimony. They found that ClustalW+MP outperformed POY with 
      respect to alignment and phylogenetic tree accuracy, and they concluded that 
      simultaneous estimation techniques are not competitive with two-phase techniques. 
      Our paper presents a simulation study in which we focus on the NP-hard optimization 
      problem that POY addresses: minimizing treelength. Our study considers the impact of 
      the gap penalty and suggests that the poor performance observed for POY by Ogden and 
      Rosenberg is due to the simple gap penalties they used to score alignment/tree 
      pairs. Our study suggests that optimizing under an affine gap penalty might produce 
      alignments that are better than ClustalW alignments, and competitive with those 
      produced by the best current alignment methods. We also show that optimizing under 
      this affine gap penalty produces trees whose topological accuracy is better than 
      ClustalW+MP, and competitive with the current best two-phase methods.

TI  - Comparison of methods for estimating the nucleotide substitution matrix.
PG  - 511
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nucleotide substitution rate matrix is a key parameter of molecular 
      evolution. Several methods for inferring this parameter have been proposed, with 
      different mathematical bases. These methods include counting sequence differences 
      and taking the log of the resulting probability matrices, methods based on Markov 
      triples, and maximum likelihood methods that infer the substitution probabilities 
      that lead to the most likely model of evolution. However, the speed and accuracy of 
      these methods has not been compared. RESULTS: Different methods differ in 
      performance by orders of magnitude (ranging from 1 ms to 10 s per matrix), but 
      differences in accuracy of rate matrix reconstruction appear to be relatively small. 
      Encouragingly, relatively simple and fast methods can provide results at least as 
      accurate as far more complex and computationally intensive methods, especially when 
      the sequences to be compared are relatively short. CONCLUSION: Based on the 
      conditions tested, we recommend the use of method of Gojobori et al. (1982) for long 
      sequences (> 600 nucleotides), and the method of Goldman et al. (1996) for shorter 
      sequences (< 600 nucleotides). The method of Barry and Hartigan (1987) can provide 
      somewhat more accuracy, measured as the Euclidean distance between the true and 
      inferred matrices, on long sequences (> 2000 nucleotides) at the expense of 
      substantially longer computation time. The availability of methods that are both 
      fast and accurate will allow us to gain a global picture of change in the nucleotide 
      substitution rate matrix on a genomewide scale across the tree of life.

TI  - Critical assessment of alignment procedures for LC-MS proteomics and metabolomics 
      measurements.
PG  - 375
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-9-375 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become a 
      prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomics and metabolomics samples. In 
      many applications multiple LC-MS measurements need to be compared, e. g. to improve 
      reliability or to combine results from different samples in a statistical 
      comparative analysis. As in all physical experiments, LC-MS data are affected by 
      uncertainties, and variability of retention time is encountered in all data sets. It 
      is therefore necessary to estimate and correct the underlying distortions of the 
      retention time axis to search for corresponding compounds in different samples. To 
      this end, a variety of so-called LC-MS map alignment algorithms have been developed 
      during the last four years. Most of these approaches are well documented, but they 
      are usually evaluated on very specific samples only. So far, no publication has been 
      assessing different alignment algorithms using a standard LC-MS sample along with 
      commonly used quality criteria. RESULTS: We propose two LC-MS proteomics as well as 
      two LC-MS metabolomics data sets that represent typical alignment scenarios. 
      Furthermore, we introduce a new quality measure for the evaluation of LC-MS 
      alignment algorithms. Using the four data sets to compare six freely available 
      alignment algorithms proposed for the alignment of metabolomics and proteomics LC-MS 
      measurements, we found significant differences with respect to alignment quality, 
      running time, and usability in general. CONCLUSION: The multitude of available 
      alignment methods necessitates the generation of standard data sets and quality 
      measures that allow users as well as developers to benchmark and compare their map 
      alignment tools on a fair basis. Our study represents a first step in this 
      direction. Currently, the installation and evaluation of the "correct" parameter 
      settings can be quite a time-consuming task, and the success of a particular method 
      is still highly dependent on the experience of the user. Therefore, we propose to 
      continue and extend this type of study to a community-wide competition. All data as 
      well as our evaluation scripts are available at http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap.

TI  - Empirical comparison of ab initio repeat finding programs.
PG  - 2284-94
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn064 [doi]
AB  - Identification of dispersed repetitive elements can be difficult, especially when 
      elements share little or no homology with previously described repeats. 
      Consequently, a growing number of computational tools have been designed to identify 
      repetitive elements in an ab initio manner, i.e. without using prior sequence data. 
      Here we present the results of side-by-side evaluations of six of the most widely 
      used ab initio repeat finding programs. Using sequence from rice chromosome 12, 
      tools were compared with regard to time requirements, ability to find known repeats, 
      utility in identifying potential novel repeats, number and types of repeat elements 
      recognized and compactness of family descriptions. The study reveals profound 
      differences in the utility of the tools with some identifying virtually their entire 
      substrate as repetitive, others making reasonable estimates of repetition, and some 
      missing almost all repeats. Of note, even when tools recognized similar numbers of 
      repeats they often showed marked differences in the nature and number of repeat 
      families identified. Within the context of this comparative study, ReAS and 
      RepeatScout showed the most promise in analysis of sequence reads and assembled 
      genomic regions, respectively. Our results should help biologists identify the 
      program(s), if any, that is best suited for their needs.

TI  - The accuracy of several multiple sequence alignment programs for proteins.
PG  - 471
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been many algorithms and software programs implemented for 
      the inference of multiple sequence alignments of protein and DNA sequences. The 
      "true" alignment is usually unknown due to the incomplete knowledge of the 
      evolutionary history of the sequences, making it difficult to gauge the relative 
      accuracy of the programs. RESULTS: We tested nine of the most often used protein 
      alignment programs and compared their results using sequences generated with the 
      simulation software Simprot which creates known alignments under realistic and 
      controlled evolutionary scenarios. We have simulated more than 30,000 alignment sets 
      using various evolutionary histories in order to define strengths and weaknesses of 
      each program tested. We found that alignment accuracy is extremely dependent on the 
      number of insertions and deletions in the sequences, and that indel size has a 
      weaker effect. We also considered benchmark alignments from the latest version of 
      BAliBASE and the results relative to BAliBASE- and Simprot-generated data sets were 
      consistent in most cases. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that employing Simprot's 
      simulated sequences allows the creation of a more flexible and broader range of 
      alignment classes than the usual methods for alignment accuracy assessment. Simprot 
      also allows for a quick and efficient analysis of a wider range of possible 
      evolutionary histories that might not be present in currently available alignment 
      sets. Among the nine programs tested, the iterative approach available in Mafft 
      (L-INS-i) and ProbCons were consistently the most accurate, with Mafft being the 
      faster of the two.

TI  - All are not equal: a benchmark of different homology modeling programs.
PG  - 1315-27
AB  - Modeling a protein structure based on a homologous structure is a standard method in 
      structural biology today. In this process an alignment of a target protein sequence 
      onto the structure of a template(s) is used as input to a program that constructs a 
      3D model. It has been shown that the most important factor in this process is the 
      correctness of the alignment and the choice of the best template structure(s), while 
      it is generally believed that there are no major differences between the best 
      modeling programs. Therefore, a large number of studies to benchmark the alignment 
      qualities and the selection process have been performed. However, to our knowledge 
      no large-scale benchmark has been performed to evaluate the programs used to 
      transform the alignment to a 3D model. In this study, a benchmark of six different 
      homology modeling programs- Modeller, SegMod/ENCAD, SWISS-MODEL, 3D-JIGSAW, nest, 
      and Builder-is presented. The performance of these programs is evaluated using 
      physiochemical correctness and structural similarity to the correct structure. From 
      our analysis it can be concluded that no single modeling program outperform the 
      others in all tests. However, it is quite clear that three modeling programs, 
      Modeller, nest, and SegMod/ ENCAD, perform better than the others. Interestingly, 
      the fastest and oldest modeling program, SegMod/ ENCAD, performs very well, although 
      it was written more than 10 years ago and has not undergone any development since. 
      It can also be observed that none of the homology modeling programs builds side 
      chains as well as a specialized program (SCWRL), and therefore there should be room 
      for improvement.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of protein structure alignment methods: scoring by 
      geometric measures.
PG  - 1173-88
AB  - We report the largest and most comprehensive comparison of protein structural 
      alignment methods. Specifically, we evaluate six publicly available structure 
      alignment programs: SSAP, STRUCTAL, DALI, LSQMAN, CE and SSM by aligning all 
      8,581,970 protein structure pairs in a test set of 2930 protein domains specially 
      selected from CATH v.2.4 to ensure sequence diversity. We consider an alignment good 
      if it matches many residues, and the two substructures are geometrically similar. 
      Even with this definition, evaluating structural alignment methods is not 
      straightforward. At first, we compared the rates of true and false positives using 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the CATH classification taken as 
      a gold standard. This proved unsatisfactory in that the quality of the alignments is 
      not taken into account: sometimes a method that finds less good alignments scores 
      better than a method that finds better alignments. We correct this intrinsic 
      limitation by using four different geometric match measures (SI, MI, SAS, and GSAS) 
      to evaluate the quality of each structural alignment. With this improved analysis we 
      show that there is a wide variation in the performance of different methods; the 
      main reason for this is that it can be difficult to find a good structural alignment 
      between two proteins even when such an alignment exists. We find that STRUCTAL and 
      SSM perform best, followed by LSQMAN and CE. Our focus on the intrinsic quality of 
      each alignment allows us to propose a new method, called "Best-of-All" that combines 
      the best results of all methods. Many commonly used methods miss 10-50% of the good 
      Best-of-All alignments. By putting existing structural alignments into proper 
      perspective, our study allows better comparison of protein structures. By 
      highlighting limitations of existing methods, it will spur the further development 
      of better structural alignment methods. This will have significant biological 
      implications now that structural comparison has come to play a central role in the 
      analysis of experimental work on protein structure, protein function and protein 
      evolution.
